      "[\"\\n\\nFrom \\n\\n to \\n\\n, Oscar voters can't get enough of book adaptations. Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in the Best Actor and Best Actress categories.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, movies have been based on books and true stories since the silent film era, but this year represents a notable spike: While true story adaptations remain relatively flat, the number of best actor or actress nominees who starred in movies based on books have reached a new peak this year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn even bigger indicator? Movies in which book and true story adaptation overlap. That has been a clear path to Oscar glory in the Best Actor category.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of this year's Best Actor nominees are from movies based on books \\n\\n true stories, except for one: Matt Damon's turn as a stranded astronaut in the science fiction thriller \\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, Oscar voters don't seem to favor true stories as much in the Best Actress category. While two out of the past three Best Actress winners have been from films based on books—Julianne Moore in \\n\\n and Jennifer Lawrence in \\n\\n, you have to go back to 2011 to find a true story adaptation taking home the award. \\n\\n\\n\\nBut let's get back to this year. The nine book-to-film adaptations nominated for a Best Actor or Best Actress Oscar fall into two very distinct groups: Based on a blockbuster book OR based on a book most people have never heard of (let alone read). \\n\\n \\n\\nBook popularity isn't everything—but it does matter, especially in the Best Actress category. The last two book-to-film adaptations to take home the Best Actress award (Julianne Moore in \\n\\n and Jennifer Lawrence in \\n\\n) were based on books with over 100k ratings on Goodreads. The opposite seems to be true for the Best Actor category. You have to go all the way back to 2003 (Sean Penn in \\n\\n) to find \\n\\n with over 50k ratings on Goodreads taking home the prize.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we combine our Goodreads book data with current Oscar trends, we're left with two predictions for the big award night:\\n\\n\\n\\nOUR PREDICTIONS\\n\\n\\n\\nA performance in a movie based on a \\n\\n and a \\n\\n\\n\\nA performance in a movie based on a \\n\\n and \\n\", 'The Lonely City\\xa0bristles with heart-piercing wisdom. Loneliness, according to Laing, feels “like being hungry when everyone around you is readying for a feast.” Later, she admits that at one point during her own hermetic existence in New York, “I felt like I was in danger of vanishing.” Thankfully\\xa0The Lonely City\\xa0goes far beyond a cry for connection in an overcrowded, overstimulated world. It’s a ghostly blueprint of urban loneliness—an emotion that Laing calls “a city in itself”—that reminds us how loneliness can sometimes bring us together.\\n\\nOver at NPR, Jason Heller\\xa0reviews Olivia Laing’s\\xa0The Lonely City, an exploration of loneliness based on her own and others’ experiences in New York City.

Unjustly, I assumed right away that I knew exactly what kind of book this would be: a book about arty people with complicated personal lives, who use the word “lover” and contemplate wintry landscapes from lonely trains.\\n\\nThere are arty people and wintry landscapes in “Cities I’ve Never Lived In.” The narrator above, who is common to many of the 14 stories, does use the word “lover,” and reflects on relationships that seem exceedingly complicated. But \\xadMajka brings the reader to startling places. The stories feature an array of discomfiting situations and hardscrabble New England lives. All of the stories are sad. A father leaves his daughter with a neighbor and rents an apartment in another town; a mother meets up with the ex-husband who killed their daughter while driving drunk. A little girl is abducted from a church day care and \\xadnever seen again. Many of them are spooky. A young man leaves a mental hospital and finds that his island home has disappeared from the map. There are doppelgängers throughout the stories — in a bookstore and on the street and in a painting hidden in an attic. Watching an old museum security tape, the narrator catches a glimpse of herself as a child.\\n\\nMajka is dexterous at bringing a physical clarity to the sites of emotional muddle; the boy in the mental hospital had “cut his wrists with his father’s coping saw, and lay on the ground watching the sawdust turn red until someone opened the door.” She excels at writing \\xadneglected, forlorn people and places. A foyer in a \\xaddingy apartment features an end table piled with old mail, mail that is “parchmenty and bowed in the middle.” The mother of the dead girl is one of a class of women “who have no femininity in them, but also nothing hard, it was just that life had brought them to having no extra gestures.” (Alice Munro is name-checked by the narrator, and her influence is perceptible throughout, although no one can achieve her particular brand of crispness.)\\n\\nIn the titular story, Majka’s main narrator conceives a plan to travel to soup kitchens around the country, talking to the poor. In one city she sees an exhibit about homeless people; she is moved by their stories but tells her mother on the phone that “it was too compassionate” to be effective. Real artists, she explains, take from people “for their own ends.” This is actually a useful annotation to \\xadMajka’s work. “Cities I’ve Never Lived In” is not a compassionate book, exactly, despite all the sad things in it. From certain angles, it’s a kind of New England gothic, where the lost children and dead women and doppelgängers serve to add atmosphere and meaning to the narrator’s past peregrinations, her dalliances and uncertainties. It turns out in the end that this is in fact a book about an arty person with a complicated personal life. But it’s a lovely one, written in a moving and uncanny register.\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES I’VE NEVER LIVED IN\\n\\n\\n\\nStories\\n\\nBy Sara Majka\\n\\n160 pp. A Public Space/Graywolf Press.

Literally.\\n\\nLike Passman himself, those sentences may have deeper meaning than they first suggest. Read one way, they say that he practices the art of magic in the traditional theatrical sense, onstage — which he does. Read another way, and allowing for a Joycean turn of phrase, they suggest that Passman has literary skills worthy of a magician. That is true — Passman is a successful mystery novelist, including the recent The Amazing Harvey, which features both a magician and a lawyer and a little-known scientific fact about DNA. Read yet another way, they could refer to Passman’s status as one of the world’s leading entertainment lawyers, specializing in the music industry, adept at the “tricks of the trade.”\\n\\nAnd finally, yet another meaning is possible, for a search for books by Donald S. Passman on Amazon reveals a doppelganger, a professor in Wisconsin who has published multiple tomes on the arcane, magical subject of advanced mathematical theory, with suspiciously magical titles such as The Algebraic Structure of Group Rings, Permutation Groups, and Infinite Crossed Products. A mere coincidence? Or an epic illusion? A magician never reveals his tricks.\\n\\nPassman’s book All You Need to Know About the Music Business, an iconic work first published in 1991 and now in its ninth edition, reveals yet another persona (thank you Ingmar Bergman, whose movies also include The Magician). This side of Passman is the expert, albeit one who writes for his audience: aspiring musicians, the kind of dreamers he has seen conquer the music industry for years, often as his clients. He likes to address his readers directly with disarming phrases such as “Well, kiddies,” or “Well, my friend,” and invitations to the reader that encapsulate the combination of law and magic that is Passman’s unique brand: “So step right up. All these secrets and more are revealed just inside the tent.”\\n\\nEver-conscious of the reader’s expectations, and well aware that his self-described prime audience of aspiring rockers may not have a scholarly bent, Passman offers the reader shortcuts, suggests what to skip, and provides disclaimers noting that the book offers an overview but not every possible angle. The way Passman writes these disclaimers serves as an enjoyable literary exercise, almost hidden between the pages of the book, while offering brief glimpses of a world of hidden tricks “behind the curtain”:\\n\\nThere is no way one book (even one filling several volumes) could poke into every nook and cranny of a business as complicated as the music business. So the purpose here is to give you the big picture, not all the details. (Besides, for some of those details, I charge serious money).\\n\\nAs part of this congenial approach, the writing makes use of intriguing metaphors where Passman the “explainer” briefly steps aside for Passman the gifted writer, as in this passage:\\n\\nSo the goal is to give you a broad overview (which doesn’t change nearly as quickly). That way you’ll have a bare tree on which to hang the leaves of your own experience. Oddly, it’s easier to pick up details (from trade publications, gossip at cocktail parties, etc.) than it is to learn the structural overview, because few people have the time or patience to sit down and give it to you. In fact, giving you the overall view turned out to be a much bigger job than I thought when I started. But you’re worth it.\\n\\nPassman’s writing deftly moves between poetic metaphor, practical advice, self-confessional, and personal support, a combination that no doubt helped him through years of dealing with highly creative and highly insecure creative artists.\\n\\nPassman’s gradually unfolding story of the music industry is like a world-class educational museum, populated by intricate scientific exhibits and beautiful sculptures. While strolling from the beginning to the end, our guide explains the monuments succinctly, with style and humor, short personal anecdotes, on-point cultural references, and great historical insight and knowledge. To our delight, and astonishment, by the end of the tour we have deep expertise, acquired effortlessly and enjoyably.\\n\\nThe museum metaphor is appropriate, since much of the complexity of the music industry can only be understood by an examination of its history, its roots. Those roots include copyright law and the way contracts have evolved in the music world. Custom and practice in music industry contracts is a devilish and arcane area where decades of one-upmanship, subtle advantage, out-of-date accommodations (10 percent deduction for broken discs?), and “gotchas” have, unfortunately, sometimes become “industry standard,” which can often be puzzling to newcomers.\\n\\nPassman’s book is noted for its superb detail, lavishing pages (and some engaging cartoon illustrations) on terms like “cross-collateralization,” presented as an unavoidable evil you need to understand, and at least try to avoid in negotiations. Without the occasional use of candid reactions such as “you won’t believe this but it’s true, no kidding kiddies,” some music industry contractual terms would, in fact, be hard to believe — Passman’s style helps him break the bad news to his readers gently and with humor. Throughout the book, we approach details only after learning the fundamental structure. Trees and leaves.\\n\\nWhen writers turn their attention to an entire industry, there are many choices to be made regarding structure, content, presentation, and organization. Passman’s journey through the industry is organized in a logical sequence for any aspiring rock star, beginning with the team of advisors employed by successful artists (agent, manager, lawyer, business manager, publicist), recording agreements, publishing agreements, group issues (a band is a partnership that requires agreements), touring, merchandising, and film music. The perspective is that of an “ultimate” success story, a high-level international artist, for whom all of these areas come into play, but it provides helpful context even if, realistically, most artists and lawyers will be dealing with only parts of this landscape.\\n\\nEspecially enjoyable are the nonstop cultural references. In a passage about traditional record sales (a business quickly being superseded by streaming, as the book notes), we get classic Passman when he describes an oppressive world that sometimes seems to go about things in its own illogical way: “So how does all this affect your royalties? To paraphrase George Orwell in Animal Farm, some record sales are more equal than others.” And again when he offers a realistic, even fatalistic assessment of deals that must, for better or for worse, give in to and accommodate greed: “In that case, you might allow the subpublisher to get as much as 50%, on the theory that your 50% is better than zero or a machete.”\\n\\nVirtually every page has “dry humor,” mild sarcasm, knowing irony, and pop culture references — “When we get to single-song sheet music, we really enter the Twilight Zone” — which helps explain why the book has been so successful over the years and is in its ninth edition (updated with “new business models” such as online streaming). It creates a safe fairy tale (or more accurately “Fractured Fairy Tale”) atmosphere for learning challenging and detailed content that might otherwise appear to be for lawyers only.\\n\\nThere are other wonderful books about the music industry (Music, Money, and Success by Jeffrey and Todd Brabec comes to mind), and in the world of independent film law, a similar informal writing style is used with great success by Michael Donaldson and Lisa Callif in Clearance and Copyright (which I reviewed for LARB last year). But in the world of the music industry, Passman’s writing style and approach is unique because it presents so much depth of content and detail in such an engaging way. For that reason, it has become an industry classic, read not only by musicians but by executives and lawyers as well, educating a generation.\\n\\nAnd that, kiddies, is real magic.\\n\\n¤\\n\\nCorey Field is Of Counsel in the Los Angeles office of national law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, where he practices copyright, trademark, and entertainment law.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to Adapt Where’s Waldo\\n\\nBy Dianna Dilworth\\xa0on Mar. 14, 2016 - 2:10 PMComment\\n\\nSeth Rogen\\xa0and\\xa0Evan Goldberg\\xa0have reportedly signed on to work on MGM’s film adaptation of Martin Handford’s children’s book franchise Where’s Waldo.\\n\\nAccording to a report on Deadline.com, “Rogen and Goldberg will become producers with their Point Grey partner James Weaver,” and “…the studio and Classic Media are setting Kyle Hunter & Ariel Shaffir to write it.”\\n\\nMGM president\\xa0Jonathan Glickman\\xa0has secured the film rights to the franchise back in 2011.\\xa0Handford published seven primary books in the\\xa0Where’s Waldo?\\xa0series.\\xa0The franchise’s non-picture book publications include fact guides, activity books and puzzle books.\\n', 'From a late nineteenth-century French advertisement.\\n\\nThe French are known for how they wear scarves. That’s such a cliché that it hardly merits repeating. But like so many clichés, it’s rooted in truth. And today I was reminded of that.\\n\\nI was at a clothing store in Paris. While I sat on a low bench and waited for a friend to emerge from the dressing room, I watched women of all ages try on scarves and wraps in front of a nearby mirror. Each woman tried on her scarf differently; some draped, some wrapped, some poufed the lengths of fabric into tall, proud collars. Several tried more than one effect, seeing how the cloth behaved. But one thing they all had in common.\\n\\nEach tried on not just a scarf but a range of attitudes. Haughty, casual, elegant. Her posture would change along with her expression; her look would not be merely appraising but far seeing. Here she would be at this party, in that weather. With a range of shirts and jackets, armor for the different battles of life.\\n\\nFor the first time I realized what people mean when they say they “hate to shop.” It’s not just a question of harsh lighting or unflattering mirrors or money or consumerism; rather, it’s the work of imagination that’s required. Who am I? You have to ask yourself. Who would I like to be? And how do the two vary? That, of course, is the hardest part. It’s where notions are put to the test; the only question is how honest you’ll be with yourself.\\n\\nThe converse is true, too, of course. In those moments at the mirror, all things are possible—at least, the moments before you put it on, or take it off, or look at the price tag. Cashmere feels just as soft to the hand that can’t afford it.\\xa0\\n\\nOne of the women—who’d had, moments before, the air of someone walking into a lavish party—saw me staring at her in the corner of the mirror. I expected a sharp reproach, but her look was merely disapproving.

In this feature, we invite writers to talk about their new books, older titles, and their writing overall.\\n\\nNext Tuesday (March 22, 2016) we will publish Broken by Susan Jane Bigelow–the first novel in the Extrahuman Union series, a dystopian future science fiction novel with superheroes trying to survive under a totalitarian regime. Today, we are delighted to invite Susan as she tells us a little bit about the Inspirations & Influences behind the novel.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease give a warm welcome to Susan Jane Bigelow, folks! \\n\\n\\n\\nBroken started the way a lot of these things do: with a post on LiveJournal.\\n\\nA long time ago I got involved in a comment thread about superhero names, and I came up with a few that I liked: Broken, Sky Ranger, and Crimson Cadet. From that, the germ of a story began to grow. How could I not want to write about super-powered people with these names?\\n\\nAnd so I did. I entered NaNoWriMo that year and managed to produce a very rough draft of Broken.\\n\\nI love superheroes, and I always have. I grew up watching the old Batman TV show and Superfriends; later I devoured the Batman animated series, Superman, Justice League, and the 1990s cartoon version of X-Men. Superheroes are a mess of questions, most of the time. Why did they take separate “hero” names, and where did those come from? How did they deal with feeling different? How do they relate to one another?\\n\\nSuperhero teams are something that especially fascinated me. How do all these incredibly powerful people get along? What could possibly bring them together? How might they break apart?\\n\\nBroken’s Extrahuman Union is a deliberate echo of these old superhero teams. It’s sort of like a mandatory version of Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters that no one can ever leave!\\n\\nMuch as I loved traditional superhero stories like Batman and Peter David’s run on the Supergirl comic book, I started to seek out alternative ways of looking at them. The Authority, The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, and The Maxx are comics that looked at superheroes through a darker, stranger lens.\\n\\nAnd so Broken herself is descended from Supergirl, Jenny Sparks, The Maxx, and even Alita from the manga Battle Angel Alita.\\n\\nThe rest of the world of Broken owes a lot to 90s science fiction TV like Babylon 5 and to all the fantastic space opera I’ve read, like Lois McMaster Bujold’s Miles Vorkosigan saga.\\n\\nThe book also owes a debt to George W. Bush. If he hadn’t beaten John Kerry in 2004, I wouldn’t have been grouchy enough to spend an entire month writing about super-powered people living under an emergent fascist regime. Thanks, George!\\n\\nBut maybe the biggest and weirdest influence on the book is a line from the Butthole Surfers song “Pepper,” which is all about teens who go courting death. It goes “Some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain / That is pouring like an avalanche, coming down the mountain.”\\n\\nThis story—this whole series—is about Broken falling in love with life.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the Novel\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post-war, future world, where first contact has been made with intelligent life and humans are colonizing the stars, the nations of Earth have been united under a central government. Extrahumans, those possessing supernatural abilities such as flight and strength, are required by this government to belong to the Union, where they can be trained, monitored, and weaponized.\\n\\nMichael Forward is cursed with the ability to see the future – every possible future – when he gazes into another person’s eyes. All he has ever wanted is to escape the grim destiny he sees when he looks in the mirror, but when he is tasked with a mission that will define the course of human history, Michael finds he cannot refuse. Now, he needs the help of a homeless ex-superhero to save a baby who may become the key to humanity’s freedom.\\n\\nBroken figured she was done with heroics when she lost the ability to fly and escaped the confinement of the Extrahuman Union. But then the world started to fall apart around her, and a desperate teenage prophet with a baby entered her life, offering her the possibility of redemption and a chance to fly once more.\\n\\nIn a time of spreading darkness, when paranoia and oppression reign, can these unlikely allies preserve a small ray of hope for a better, brighter future?\\n\\nHow to Get the Book\\n\\nBroken will be published officially on March 22, 2016.

I wanted to be Jo, with her ink-stained hands and big dreams. I wanted to be the rebel storyteller. I never, ever forgave Amy for burning Jo’s manuscript (I suspect this is also why I can’t stand the sight\\xa0of Kirsten Dunst) and I\\xa0begrudged the passage of time, the inevitable growing up that\\xa0came with it.\\n\\nRe-reading Little Women was my equivalent of curling up under a warm blanket and pulling it over my head. It was me shutting out the rest of the world. It\\xa0was me looking for\\xa0comfort, not craft (though it’s certainly there), in the pages.\\xa0All I intended\\xa0to do\\xa0was fall in love with story again.\\n\\nThe last the time I read Little Women,\\xa0publishing a book was nowhere\\xa0near a reality for me. Who we are inevitably changes how we read the books we love: suddenly I was catching bits of Louisa May Alcott’s\\xa0feminism I hadn’t noticed as a young reader, and I found myself chuckling at her jabs at the publishing industry. In a scene where Jo submits her\\xa0manuscript to an editor, Alcott writes he said\\xa0“We’ll take this.” Then she adds: “(editors never say ‘I’)”.\\n\\nThough I didn’t highlight or take notes, I dog-eared several\\xa0passages. Then this\\xa0morning, before I got back to work on my manuscript, I revisited the book\\xa0and found this:\\n\\n\\nIn her first post of 2016, Lindsey Mead writes\\xa0about how, instead of resolutions, she chooses a word of the year (or rather, the word chooses her). I’d hoped one would choose me as well, then promptly forgot about it until I re-opened my copy of Little Women.\\n\\nSo, yes, they’re more like eight words, but they speak to me.\\n\\nThey\\xa0are\\xa0exactly how I want to live and write this year.\\n', 'Every year, millions of people visit California in search of beaches, hiking, celebrity sightings, and more.

The Villa represented the past as if it were new, without any of the sense of passage of time separating out the visitor from antiquity. This staging elicited all manner of hand-wringing over issues of authenticity. It’s pristine condition discomfited critics; its sense that the imagined brought forth the many comparisons, both positive and negative, with Disneyland”\\n\\nPeter J.

Over the course of these books, we watch these very human superheroes fly, fall, and dream of freedom.\\n\\nToday, author Susan Jane Bigelow is here with an introduction to the series, particularly for the first book, Broken.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Extrahuman Union: A Primer\\n\\nThe Extrahuman Union series is simple to sum up—it’s about superheroes in space in the future fighting an authoritarian regime. There. Easy.\\n\\nBut it’s also about an awful lot more than that. \\n\\nI started writing this series twelve years ago, and put the finishing touches on it in 2015. A lot has changed for me since then, and I’m sure the themes I chose to focus on reflect that. But here’s a quick outline of the major themes, major characters, and more.\\n\\nThe format is one that I use a lot: each book has a separate main character or characters, and can often stand alone, but they add up to a single overarching story. \\n\\nSo what about these characters? There’s… quite a few of them, about two dozen major characters and countless minor ones. The major two that appear in Broken, the first book in the series, are Broken herself, and Michael Forward.\\n\\nBroken started her life as a member of the Extrahuman Union named Silverwing, a name she later altered to Silverwyng to seem more interesting. She does not know her given name, nor does she remember her parents. Any children with extrahuman abilities are taken to be raised in Union Tower. Her abilities are flight and super-fast healing which renders her functionally immortal. She joined the Union’s Law Enforcement Division in order to be near her lover, the Union’s leader Sky Ranger. \\n\\nSilverwyng – Art by Kirbi Fagan\\n\\nAt some point, she loses her flight abilities and her relationship with Sky Ranger ends. Despondent, she flees the Union and gives herself the name Broken. When we meet her nearly a decade later, Broken is living on the streets of New York. She still has her healing abilities, but she is tough, cynical, and often blind to the world around her. \\n\\nThis series is essentially her story, told through her own point of view and the points of view of characters around her. \\n\\nMichael Forward is a teenage boy with a heavy burden: he can see many possible futures whenever he looks at someone—including himself. He’s seen enough possibilities that he has a general sense of where things are going, and he knows he has to act. He has extrahuman abilities, but he’s not a member of the Union. He’s been kept away from them and guided by Joe, a friend of Michael’s parents who entrusted him to Joe’s care before they died.\\n\\nMichael, when we meet him, is looking for Broken. He believes that she is the key to the future.\\n\\nThese books are about dealing with the burdens of fate and destiny, about how to go on living when you’re being ground into the dust by an oppressive regime, and how to be yourself when what you are is dangerous and feared. They are about freedom, despair, betrayal, miracles, and even love. \\n\\nI hope you check them out. Thank you all for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the Novel\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a post-war, future world, where first contact has been made with intelligent life and humans are colonizing the stars, the nations of Earth have been united under a central government. Extrahumans, those possessing supernatural abilities such as flight and strength, are required by this government to belong to the Union, where they can be trained, monitored, and weaponized.\\n\\nMichael Forward is cursed with the ability to see the future – every possible future – when he gazes into another person’s eyes. All he has ever wanted is to escape the grim destiny he sees when he looks in the mirror, but when he is tasked with a mission that will define the course of human history, Michael finds he cannot refuse. Now, he needs the help of a homeless ex-superhero to save a baby who may become the key to humanity’s freedom.\\n\\nBroken figured she was done with heroics when she lost the ability to fly and escaped the confinement of the Extrahuman Union. But then the world started to fall apart around her, and a desperate teenage prophet with a baby entered her life, offering her the possibility of redemption and a chance to fly once more.\\n\\nIn a time of spreading darkness, when paranoia and oppression reign, can these unlikely allies preserve a small ray of hope for a better, brighter future?\\n\\nHow to Get the Book\\n\\nBroken will be officially published on March 22, 2016.

His eyes blaze and his whole body crashes into hers like a continent. Forests of hair where she has none, he is a man. She is a girl.\\n\\nOpposites attract.\\n\\nThere is a differential, a gap in experience. Mind it. He’s lived through a dozen romances, but it’s her first time, really deep, madcap heart-crushing, barely breathing. Is this love or infatuation? It takes more than thirteen\\xa0short years to know.\\n\\nShe wants. Who is she? Sable and Lori and Mandy and Myra and Virginia and Priscilla and Dolores and me. We want to explore the continent with our mouths. His strong hard on our tiny bodies. The flesh of him.\\n\\nNobody listened when I said I wanted it. Nobody believed me about how it felt in my body. It felt like I was jumping off a high ledge, tied by a magic string. Safe, but falling; I was free. Everyone told me that I’d grow up and see what happened was clearly wrong. That he was a predator, and I was a victim. I just heard that they wanted to clip my wings.\\n\\nFor ten years, I guarded my version of events with all the fierceness I had left. I wasn’t a child, I insisted. I knew how his body worked, and knew how to work my own. I knew how to flick my eyelashes, lift my arms so just a sliver of soft belly peeked above my jeans. I could grab gazes like they were candy. If I ever felt guilty, I pushed it away. Hey, it wasn’t my fault that the world was full of men like the one who let me steal sunglasses from the mini-mart because I let him leer at me wiggling down the aisle. It wasn’t my fault men went fish-faced at the sight of me.\\n\\nI knew my desire felt like drowning in thick honey, and I knew how to let the slick of my want slide onto the tops of my thighs. I knew what it felt like to be wanted. To see a grown man on his knees, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. And better: to believe him.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThis story. The one I’m about to tell you? Some of it is a lie.\\n\\nWhen I was thirteen, my mom’s friend, Debbie, came to visit. Debbie was my mom’s single friend—she had never married, and she was the stuff of legend. She owned a boutique, went to fashion conventions, and drove a red Firebird with a T-top. Debbie was the essence of single womanhood—confident, with her own money, and a lot of sass.\\n\\nI noticed right away that Debbie’s hair looked different. Much longer than I remembered, and gorgeously permed, these cascading blonde curls hanging down around her mid-back. Looking at it, for the first time, I realized that there was hair, and then there was hair.\\n\\nImagine how delighted I was when Debbie unclipped the long, sexy hair from behind her bangs. She was still beautiful, just less than “MTV video queen beautiful.” The dirty blonde, shoulder length hair I remembered appeared.\\n\\n“It’s a fall,” she said. “I got it at one of my conventions, and let me tell you, when I want to be noticed, it’s a godsend. I nicknamed it Dobbie—that’s my alternate personality when I wear it. You can’t imagine how quickly men offer to pump my gas when I pull in as Dobbie. When I go out as Dobbie, all my drinks are free.”\\n\\nDobbie was a superwoman. Powerful. Bringing men to heel.\\n\\nI coveted her more and more as the minutes passed, as I stroked the curls of Dobbie, and wanted her for my very own. She seemed magical to my thirteen-year-old heart, which was already weary of being ignored. I thought if I had Dobbie, the boys I liked would fall to their knees instead of barely looking at me while they asked me if I thought my best friend, Paige, would want to go out with them.\\n\\n“Try it on,” Debbie interrupted. “Your hair is close enough—I think it will match.”\\n\\nI eyed her in disbelief before assenting. Me? Really?\\n\\nDebbie clipped the fall into my hair, about halfway back, near the crown of my head. The curls cascaded over my shoulders and down my back. I have never had hair this long, and never so thick, so curly, so… grown up. I ran to the bathroom to check myself out in the mirror. Dobbie hid my awkward hairline pimples and overshadowed my dorky, long denim shorts. I was a dreamgirl version of myself.\\n\\nI fluffed Dobbie and strutted provocatively around the bathroom. I bent from the waist and watched the hair swing down and all around my body. I watched my body move, my neck seemed longer. I looked older, powerful, bordering on womanly.\\n\\nI ran out to the living room, and asked if I could go show Paige.\\n\\nMy mother barely looked up from chatting with Debbie and waved me off.\\n\\nI strutted through the neighborhood. Near the main road, I stopped to tie a shoelace. As I was crouched over, a car whizzed by, and out of the window flew my first wolf whistle.\\n\\nI blushed, and then I straightened into it. Like being hit, but deciding to embrace the sting instead of fight.\\n\\nI felt visible. Watched. Noticed. It was as though the long march of prepuberty had ended, and finally there was something worth liking about me. And sure, I told myself, it was probably the hair. And sure, I knew that it wasn’t even my real hair. But still.\\n\\nThis was how I realized that I wanted, more than anything else, to be desired.\\n\\nBefore this, I always blended in. Sure, once you got to know me, I was interesting. I could hold a conversation with an adult. I was charming even. Witty. But that took more than a passing glance to know.\\n\\nWhat I wanted now, what I realized was the most important thing, was to be recognizably special. I wanted to be hot. Sexy. Wanted.\\n\\nAnd this was how I came to understand my power. My body was a sword. My mirror was the whetting stone.\\n\\n*\\n\\nI first encountered Lolita, Nabokov’s nymphet, when I was twelve\\xa0years old. Adrian Lyne was remaking the classic film, and held an open casting call in San Francisco for a new Lolita. To prepare, I watched Kubrick’s film on the couch with my mother, eyes glued to the screen, insides molten with the dawning realization that there were other girls like me. I thought I was alone.\\n\\nLolita in the book was twelve\\xa0years old, like me, but in the film they made her fourteen\\xa0to make viewers more comfortable. Like me, Lolita was a victim of a desire she didn’t understand. Until I was thirty\\xa0years old, I thought Lolita was a heroine. I also thought that girls like Lolita and me were rare.\\n\\nSable was thirteen\\xa0when she had sex with Iggy Pop. Lori was fourteen\\xa0when she was kidnapped by Jimmy Page’s tour manager and delivered to his hotel room. But she was thirteen\\xa0when she lost her virginity to David Bowie. Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones started dating Mandy at thirteen, but waited until she was fourteen\\xa0to have sex with her. Jerry Lee Lewis and Edgar Allen Poe married their thirteen-year-old cousins, Myra and Virginia, respectively.\\n\\nPriscilla was fourteen\\xa0when she met Elvis Presley; she married him seven years later. She was forged by a man during the exact period of time when she should have been forming her sense of self. “I was someone he created,” she said. “I was just a kid and I was consumed by him. All I desired was not to disappoint him.”\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen I tell you that my life’s ambition was to be a famous actress, I want you to understand. I don’t mean that it was a hobby. I mean that from the age of five, when I first stepped into a yellow spotlight on the apron of a high school auditorium, until the age of nineteen, when I stepped onto a plane and left NYU, my singular obsession was to transform myself into the kind of great actress that makes history.\\n\\nWhen I tell you about him, I want you to understand. He wasn’t just my teacher. He was the rockstar teacher of our theater program. He taught Shakespeare—the hardest, and most lauded subject. He went to Juilliard—the impossible, and most lauded school. He was born in Trinidad, and the traces of his accent under his Juilliard-perfect diction were exotic to a bunch of high schoolers, many of whom felt he was the greatest thing to ever happen to our school.\\n\\nHe was handsome and funny and accessible. Add to that his immense talent as a performer, and his genuine skill as a teacher. Add to that his personal charisma. His voice had a natural vibration, like a timpani drum, and it thrummed across our bodies when he spoke. Add to that he was a flirty person, really. With all of us, men and women, he had that sparkly look in his eye that said he knew what the rules were, and might sometimes break them. He was engaging. He cared what we thought. He made time for us before and after class, to tutor us and coach us.\\n\\nWhen he asked me to babysit his three-year-old for him and his wife, I felt like I should be paying him.\\n\\nWhen he kissed me, finally, after nearly a year of me pining for him to do it, I want you to understand how it felt. Not just the kiss part, which was magically soft and aggressive—a grown man’s kiss. I want you to understand that it also felt like I had won something. Not just his affection, his desire, his gaze. I had won the grand prize that all of my friends were after: the gorgeous, smart, talented, funny, and totally admired teacher.\\n\\nI was on top of the world.\\n\\nIf this was victimization, my body had no idea. I was overflowing want and desire, I melted into his touch, my breath came fast, when it came at all. I lifted myself toward him, pressed closer, begged with all of my body language. If this was being exploited, if this was wrong? It didn’t feel bad. And I didn’t want to hear otherwise for a very long time.\\n\\nThere were moments, of course, when I felt a suspicion that I was actually overwhelmed. The same body that told me what felt good gave me indications that something was wrong. Idiot lights, but I ignored them. My feelings were too large, too foggy. I could barely breathe with him, let alone get my bearings. It was years before I knew how to say no, I’ve had enough. It was in my thirties that I discovered that I could handle the anxiety of rejecting a man, and that I was free to prioritize my comfort in my own body over making a man happy. At sixteen, I didn’t recognize a clear thought: that this was maybe a kiss too far, a squeeze too much, a mouthful of something that I didn’t really want to swallow, but didn’t know how to spit out. I didn’t know how to protect myself if that meant disappointing men.\\n\\nWhat if I hurt his feelings?\\n\\nI never worried about hurting myself. To suffer for my beauty felt like the natural order of things.\\n\\nThere were moments when I left my body to be with him, and my head floated near the ceiling. At the time, I thought those were indicators of my intense love and desire. I thought this was normal. It took me twelve years and a lot of digging into my guts with a therapist to understand that these moments were, in fact, markers of a trauma that I didn’t believe had occurred.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen I first started writing about myself as a teenage girl, I could only write in second person. You. As though she were so completely separated from me, she was a different person. You wanted it. You thought you were mature. You went over to his house of your own free will, and laid yourself on the floor in front of him. You were wet. You said yes. You had agency and desire. You were the one with the leverage. He lost everything, and you had nothing to lose.\\n\\nJust recently, I began to see what I lost. It wasn’t a job, a wife, a house. There was no tangible evidence of my fall, no record of my mistakes to be expunged. There was only the wreckage of my early adulthood, the loss of my unstoppable nature, and the empty hole where once my confidence grew. There was only a string of decisions to run and run again, to hide from ambition, to leave the theater forever, and to disown my dedication as a childish fantasy. And the reinforcement of my suspicion that I was only visible when I was wanted, and that nothing about me would ever eclipse my objecthood.\\n\\nHe lost his job; I lost everything but.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhen the whole world spins at his tempo, and he only has eyes for you, his gaze feels like power with an aftertaste of wonder. Wonderful. Wonderfalling.\\n\\nLolita lifts her mouth to his. Does she desire? In his fiction, she dares herself desire. Everything about her is filtered through Humbert’s narration; we only know what he will allow us to know, and what he sees is want. Her want is tidal, all of her spent crashing against the beach of him.\\n\\nWhat might have been her slow self-discovery, he takes as his opportunity.\\n\\nAnd what does he do? With great power comes great responsibility. Did he forget? Who was the first man to permit himself this? Before Humbert, before Jagger, before Bowie, even before Poe. How far back does this permission go?\\n\\nHe is supposed to say no.\\n\\nWhy doesn’t he say no?\\n\\n*\\n\\nDebbie drove a red Firebird with a T-top. I loved that car and the way it looked both feminine and powerful with her behind the wheel. I stared out the window and watched Debbie as she pulled in and out of the driveway, craning my neck to see her disappear down the street.\\n\\nOne day when I was still thirteen, while Debbie and my mom were smoking pot on the deck, I snuck into the house and took Debbie’s keys from her purse. I knew how to start a car. I thought I could handle the steering part.\\n\\nI hadn’t anticipated the manual transmission.\\n\\nI sat in the Firebird, in the driveway, keys poised in hand, for a long time. The heat got oppressive, the air turned thick. I put the key in the ignition and I flicked it to accessory. I wanted to press my foot down against the pedals and zoom off.\\n\\nI sat in the car and stared at the gear shaft.\\n\\nI wouldn’t admit it, but I was afraid.\\n\\nThat night I had a dream that I had started the Firebird and driven off alone.\\n\\nI couldn’t see well, I noticed that right away. The night was too dark, and the headlights were dim gold holes in an otherwise overwhelming blackness. The windshield was there, but it wasn’t a portal to the road ahead, the way I was anticipating. The road was unlit. A small town, neighborhood road. It wasn’t even paved that well, let alone marked by streetlamps. There was only one streetlamp on my street, way down at the corner. I used to run into its little golden puddle of safety when I walked home in the dark, and got spooked by the witches I imagined in the shadows. In my dream, even my streetlamp showed me nothing of the road.\\n\\nI could steer, but only with my instincts. If I thought about it too much, if I tried to concentrate on the words like left and right, the wheel rattled under my hands and the car seemed to buckle. If I relaxed and simply shifted my weight, the car did better. It was responsive, like it was made to hold me. Like it was mine. When I wanted to go faster, it flew beneath my body like we were one thing. Girl and machine. A fembot of my own imagination.\\n\\nI felt the horrible lurching bump at the same moment that I heard the sound. Banging. I had hit something. It was big. Bad. My heart started racing. I couldn’t get my dreambrain around what had happened; I hadn’t seen anything coming.\\n\\nIn the rearview mirror, everything was lit up, as though behind me were a million streetlamps, all of them glowing their cold, purple light onto the macadam. I could see, clear as day, what I’d hit, and I felt the sickness rise up in my body. My stomach twisted. On the road. Not dead, but rising. It was the unmistakeable body of a man.\\n\\n***\\n\\nRumpus original art by Jyotsna Warikoo Designs.\\n\\nRelated Posts:\\n', 'Molly Bang’s Picture This is her personal exploration as she works to analyze the emotional effects of art.

Like so much else in Charlie Jane Anders’s All the Birds in the Sky, the question of sanity is relative, not absolute.\\n\\nAll the Birds in the Sky is a genre-crossing sci-fi, fantasy, literary romance that pulses with energy. Anders seamlessly combines the futuristic vision of William Gibson with a fantastic, Terry Pratchett–like playfulness. The book presents a richly imagined magical world, an empathetic understanding of what it feels like to grow up an outsider, and a loving vision of a pre-apocalyptic near-future in San Francisco, the city where Anders lives and works. This book is being billed as her “debut novel for adults,” although she’s written one YA novel, lots of shorter fiction (over 100 stories, according to her official bio), and countless blog entries and essays as the founder and editor of io9, the sci-fi arm of Gawker Media.\\n\\nPatricia, a witch, and Laurence, a mad scientist, are children at the novel’s outset, and are just beginning to explore their capabilities. Both are social outcasts with uncomfortable relationships with their families. Their friendship begins as a transaction meant to keep Laurence from having to return to wilderness camp, but they quickly become each other’s only allies. Anders writes about the indignities of adolescence with gentle, empathetic humor. “At last he understood what all those old horror stories meant when they talked about an eldritch dread, creeping into your very soul. That was how Laurence felt, listening to his mother attempt to talk to him about girls.”\\n\\nIt’s not just the stifling mortification of talking about dating with a parent: the push for conformity in the children’s community is oppressive to everyone in it. The most popular boy in school has body image issues; an assassin serving as a guidance counselor (a favorite of the student body at large) is numbed by the mindlessness of the American educational system. Patricia in particular is subjected to a campaign that’s Carrie-like in its cruelty. It’s made worse by the fact that it’s undertaken by a gaslighting authority figure, who ultimately drives both children from their homes in attempt to prevent his hallucinatory but perhaps prophetic vision that one day they will bring about the end of the world.\\n\\nWe catch up with Laurence and Patricia again later, as grown-ups, in San Francisco. The Harry Potter years are only visited through flashback. In the meantime, Patricia has gone to magic school, while Laurence went to MIT. He’s become the golden boy figurehead employee for a visionary tech entrepreneur, and Patricia is doing secret witchy things around the city (and maintaining multiple day jobs to pay rent). Anders keeps the focus on the solipsistic SF tech scene, but even the tech bubble isn’t impervious to signs that the world outside is changing. The large-scale disasters, both natural and manmade, that are happening with increasing frequency across the rest of the world may not have reached the West Coast yet, but their effects are impossible to avoid. A lame party is made even more of a bummer by the fact that “everybody felt guilty about drinking soju after what happened in Korea.” The party must go on, though, even if the dubthrash DJ was making “everybody’s eardrums bleed with the most dreary shit imaginable,” and thank god it does, because this is where Patricia and Laurence meet again.\\n\\nThe tech world and the magic world are set up as opposing ideological forces, with institutional goals that will inevitably butt up against each other. Both factions are powerful and well intentioned; both have plans that are myopic and could have devastating consequences. Narratively, both forces function the same way. The magical mechanism that allows one character to turn into a bird is explained no more clearly than the scientific process that allows another character to build a two-second time machine. The explanation isn’t necessary, though. What’s more important is how Patricia and Laurence use their respective powers, and the questions such uses raise. Are ethics universal or situational? What if you’re sure you’re right, but someone else is too?\\n\\nAs Patricia and Laurence’s orbits begin to intersect more and more frequently, and the world gets closer and closer to the brink of destruction, it becomes clear that there could be some truth to the horrible destiny foreseen by that long-ago assassin. Which means that they have to face even tougher questions. When it comes to saving the world, what’s worth sacrificing, and what’s worth saving? How do you even know if it’s actually the end of the world? As one character asks, “What if we’re only eighty percent sure it’s the apocalypse?” There are no easy answers; in fact there may be no answers at all.\\n\\nNo single Big Bad exists in All the Birds in the Sky, no clear force of evil that must be defeated. Even the worst characters are well intentioned, if destructive, and the best solutions tend to wreak at least as much havoc as the problems they are intended to solve. This refusal of easy fixes is one of the book’s greatest strengths. In showing humans as both incredibly powerful and incredibly inconsequential, it assumes the best of its readers, and the best of its characters. Humans do very bad things, to be sure, with great regularity, but there is no single individual who can change the course of history. “History is a tidal wave,” another character says. “You can’t swim against a tidal wave.” In the book, as in life, the metaphor may or may not be accurate.\\n\\nIn an interview with Wired, Anders shared a few of her major literary and cultural influences (from Piers Plowman to Doris Lessing), but myriad others season the book — through both explicit allusions and subtler cues too numerous to count. Pop culture references pepper the text. At one point, one of the protagonists deflects a question with the quick answer: “Dimensional transcendentalism,” to which the frustrated questioner responds, “You just stole that from Doctor Who. This is not a joke, this is serious.” In one brief passage, a self-fashioned superhero (although she does not call herself that) intervenes in the life of a poet who seems straight out of the pages of Armistead Maupin; in another she intervenes in an assault reminiscent of a Lidia Yuknavitch essay. Fairy tale tropes are turned on their heads to wonderful effect. The characters doing the saving and the sacrificing aren’t whom you’d expect, and they’re not sacrificing what you’d think. Gender roles are inverted; magic interventions shape science in ways that can’t be explained; birds meet and tweet endlessly to each other about parliamentary points and arcane inquiries.\\n\\nEvery review I’ve read has identified different influences, from Daniel Pinkwater to Lev Grossman to Dave Eggers and beyond. They’re all correct, which is not to say the book’s derivative, because it’s not. Anders makes the old brand new again, synthesizing something lovely and urgent from all of these disparate sources. Familiar elements form the foundation of the story, but the way that they’re used yields the most joyful apocalypse novel I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. The world of All the Birds in the Sky is as rich and wonderful as it is cruel, and even as situations spiral out of the characters’ control, there’s a fundamental optimism about humanity at the heart of the book.\\n\\nAs the questions of apocalypse become too urgent to ignore, Patricia and Laurence must find answers, not necessarily the right answers, but answers. It’s an impossible, divisive task. Anders writes gorgeous, exciting prose, and the moral and narrative complexity she’s set up in All the Birds in the Sky carries all the way through its ambitious, heartbreaking, hopeful ending. This book has been tremendously well received, and will most likely earn itself a place on the shelf among all its venerable influencers as a new addition to the canon. I don’t want to overhype anything; it’s probably due for a takedown, just to compensate for all the buzz. That won’t come from me, though.\\n\\n¤\\n\\nKate Burns is a writer who lives in Los Angeles.\\n', '\\nBy \\n\\n posted at 3:30 pm on March 30, 2016 \\n\\nRecommended Reading: Does commercial literature hurt literary fiction?\\n\\n\\n', 'by Dark Horse Books\\n\\nHardcover, 213 pages |\\n\\nBuy Featured Book\\n\\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the deal with EC Comics, anyway? In the modern crusade to improve comics\\' reputation and win a place alongside \"legitimate\" art, this defunct early-\\'50s publisher would seem like a poor ambassador. EC\\'s offerings were unapologetically lurid and just as unapologetically ludicrous. \"Brace yourselves for the impact of the shocking wind-up to this yarn!\" bellows the first story in Dark Horse\\'s collection of the EC title Shock SuspenStories. In it, a woman cuts her husband into tiny pieces and labels them in jars. A later story features a woman flogged to death; its introduction reads, \"Here is an electrifying story with solid impact in its startling conclusion!\" Baaa-dump.\\n\\nIn fact, the tales in Shock SuspenStories aren\\'t all that shocking. Publisher Bill Gaines and his editor Al Feldstein returned repeatedly to similar tropes in such titles as Tales From the Crypt, Two-Fisted Tales and Weird Fantasy. In Shock SuspenStories the favorite outcome is poetic justice of the gory variety. A brutish lumberjack, having beaten a rival until he blinds him, is later hacked to death with an axe unknowingly wielded by the blind man. The cruel boss of an orphanage, refusing to let the kids celebrate Halloween, has his head turned into a jack-o-lantern. An avid hunter, his lodge decorated with a bearskin rug, is himself made into a human-skin rug.\\n\\nTales like these are even more puerile than the typical low-budget horror movie. It\\'s not too surprising that, a few years after EC began publishing, it became the focus of Congressional hearings and comic-book bonfires. All these years later, though, the censors look like jerks. This edition of Shock SuspenStories (notably, with a forward by Steven Spielberg) is only the latest of a raft of collector\\'s volumes issued by different publishers recently. In 2007 an all-new Tales From the Crypt comic appeared, and 2013 saw biographies of illustrator Wally Wood and editor/writer/artist Al Feldstein.\\n\\nIt\\'s not too surprising that, a few years after EC began publishing, it became the focus of Congressional hearings and comic-book bonfires. All these years later, though, the censors look like jerks. \\n\\nPart of the secret is the art; EC hired some of the top commercial freelancers of the day. In these pages Wood displays his gift for eloquent faces and clever layouts, Jack Davis presents gnarled visages and twisted forms, and Joe Orlando shows off a brilliant palette and angelic female features. Jack Davis and Graham Ingels are less remarkable, but it\\'s fascinating to see how each artist defines himself using such ridiculous raw material.\\n\\nAt least, it\\'s mostly ridiculous. From time to time Gaines and Feldstein published serious or semi-serious work, as when they illustrated Ray Bradbury stories. They also took on the issues of the day — albeit ones that lent themselves to violence and gore. \"The Patriots!,\" drawn by Davis, depicted violence at a political rally; it could almost be about our current election season. The Wood-illustrated \"The Guilty!\" concerns racist violence in a small town. By the time it ran, in the third issue, the editors knew their work mattered to readers out there. \"I have always felt, somehow, that EC mags are \\'personally mine,\\'\" wrote Ruby MacDonell of Raleigh, N.C., in one letter printed in SuspenStories 4.\\n\\nSuch letters point to the final ingredient of EC\\'s appeal through the years: It provided a sense of belonging stemming from a shared experience of culture. It\\'s no accident that Mad magazine was first published by EC. Gaines and his crew stumbled onto a mixture of humor, horror, melodrama and sheer absurdity that not only spoke to people, it made people feel they were one of a select group who \"got it.\" Strikingly, Playboy, with its complex promise of masculine camaraderie, was founded about the same time. But you didn\\'t need a pricey lifestyle to belong to EC\\'s world. You didn\\'t even need to be a man (though it\\'s true that women are rarely treated well in the comics). You just had to be attuned to Gaines and Feldstein\\'s unique frequency. You had to know that when they had one of their creations chew off his own leg to escape a bear trap, another get his innards removed because he kept telling his underlings they \"got no guts!\" and a third chop up his wife and squish her parts into model-train cars, they were kidding.

She tweets at @EtelkaL.\\n', 'The Caped Crusade\\n\\nby Glen Weldon\\n\\nMarch 22, 2016 · Simon & Schuster\\n\\nFor those of you who listen to NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour podcast, you know who Glen Weldon is. \\xa0He writes about “books and comics books for the NPR website,” per the intro, and he’s a giant comic book nerd. He’s been excitedly, in his Weldonian way, talking about this book for the past year or so – writing, editing, recording the audiobook, selecting the author photograph – and now it’s here. It is\\xa0everything he promised it would be.\\n\\nThis is a concise history of Batman: it’s not a comprehensive listing of every storyline that he’s ever been through, but a history of his creation and the writers and artists that presented him for the world. It’s also a tracing of how the evolution of nerd culture both had an affect and an effect on the world of Batman as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy own history with Batman involves seeing the 1989 Tim Burton movie in the theater (I was 11) and I got the VHS and watched it every day one Christmas break. I loved that movie, and unironically loved the 60s television show when it was on in reruns. I read some of the Robin and Nightwing comics; I waited breathlessly for future Batman movies until I got burned.\\n\\n\\nWeldon is proudly a nerd. It’s clear that he’s always been one, and while he functions in the world of “normals” (his word), he’s not a part of it. (I am a geek, but I straddle the worlds of nerdery and normalcy, and find myself often translating between the two and getting constantly frustrated with both.) When you listen to him on PCHH, he has a quality to his voice that marks him as a nerd – over-enunciated “r”s, for one thing. \\xa0I’m not saying anything that he hasn’t said himself, and\\xa0there’s a vocal quality that marks our people. I can hear the cadence from half a block away.\\n\\nSo when he’s talking about the rise of nerd culture, he knows what he’s talking about, from a dude nerd perspective. When the concept of Batman moved from the comic book shop to television in the 60s, there was an uprising of rage among the comic book fans of the time that the show in all of it’s candy-colored, ridiculous, pop-art glory wasn’t the “real” Batman, and suddenly all these people who hadn’t put in their time appreciating the “pure” Batman of the comic felt like they KNEW Batman.\\n\\nNerds disagreed.\\n\\nAnd this thing of “Batman is accessible to the people,” much to the dismay and distress of “pure” Batman fans everywhere, has played out over and over again, and Weldon traces that, along with the effect the rise of the internet had on that culture. Suddenly instead of gathering in groups at comic book stores or writing into fan magazines, they could gather\\xa0in large virtual groups online without even putting on pants (full disclosure: I’m writing this review in my PJs. Fuck pants).\\n\\nWhen large groups can suddenly shift the narrative from “yay we’re getting a Batman movie!” (1989…..kind of….) to “Joel Schumacher is a fake nerd who doesn’t know shit about Batman and Batman and Robin is gonna suck!” that shift has a distinct effect on how pop culture even functions.\\n\\n\\n\\n(To be fair, \\n\\n DID suck. I watched it twice, and the second time was because I couldn’t believe that it was as bad as I remembered. It was.)\\n\\n\\nWeldon’s thesis isn’t that “Batman created nerd culture as we know it” but “here’s a case study of how this societal shift happened in this particular subculture.” What’s really interesting to me is how Hollywood has learned to manage the nerd-rage game. Joel Schumacher was seen as an outsider, while Christopher Nolan managed to position himself as “One of Us.” What that did is made the Batman nerds protective of the Nolan movies – to the point of making death threats to critics who give the movies bad reviews.\\n\\nWeldon also touches on the ways that men and women tend to engage when\\xa0they celebrate their nerdery. Men tend towards curation: collecting things and exacting replicas.\\xa0Women tend towards creation: fanfic and \\xa0cosplay. There’s always been tension between these two approaches, and Weldon sums it up thusly:\\n\\nNerd culture is often open and inclusive, when it is powered by the desire to seek out others who share common interests and enthusiasms. \\xa0But nerdish passion is strong and unmindful; its very nature is to obliterate dispassion, nuance, ambiguity, and push human experience to the other edge of a binary extreme: My thing is the best. Your thing is the worst.\\n\\nMoreover, if you do not love my thing in the same way, to the same degree, and for exactly the same reasons that I do, you are doing it wrong.\\n\\nThat’s pretty much the crux of it.\\n\\nAs a history of Batman, this is pretty good. As a discussion of how nerd culture weaved its way in and amongst the BatCycles, this is fascinating. Weldon knows what he’s talking about, and he knows it because he’s lived the past 40 years as a nerd. He was there on the inside, but he’s smart enough and has enough self-awareness to be able to see the bigger picture.\\n\\nI’m still pondering what implications this has for Romancelandia.\\n\\nThis book is available from:\\n\\nMarch 22, 2016\\n', 'Last week was a big week for my family. My youngest sister, LeeAnn, works at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. LeeAnn, an experiencer of life who got back from a trip to see Machu Pichu in early March, has already worked there for four years. I decided we needed to make the trip out there this year if we wanted to see it with her. It was the best decision I made in a long time.\\n\\nSince our flights from Virginia to Phoenix were lengthy, I brought two books with me. I’d started The Big Rewind during my #sadsadbookfunk (lasted about six weeks beginning after I finished The Opposite of Everyone – fanfreakingtastic – until I started reading Did You Ever Had a Family), but I hadn’t gotten far. I knew it wasn’t the book that was holding me back. It was me. I finished this hipsteresque cozy mystery just before we arrived in Phoenix. It was a fun read and a good palate cleanser. What I loved about it the most were the song title chapter titles. They brought back a lot of high school and college memories. I took a picture on the plane after I finished it.\\n\\nWe arrived in Phoenix on Monday and had a nice dinner with my Aunt Marcia and cousin. Tuesday we had lunch in Sedona (so beautiful!) on the way to LeeAnn’s house in Prescott. My goal for Prescott was to stop by their indie bookstore while the girls went with LeeAnn and Zack to see the lack and do a little rock climbing. Danny and I got as far as parking near the bookstore before finding out that Allison had fallen into the lake and needed a change of clothes. I need another book like I need a hole in my head, but I was a little disappointed to not get a chance to go inside Peregrine Book Company Tuesday evening.\\n\\nAll was forgotten, however, when we got to the Grand Canyon on Wednesday. It was so much more than I had expected. I got tears in my eyes when I first saw it. LeeAnn took the girls on a mule ride along the rim, so Danny and I went for a walk to explore on foot. That’s where I took my favorite picture of the trip.\\n\\n\\n\\nThursday was my favorite day of all. We slept in, had a nice breakfast, and explored all day together as a family with Zack and LeeAnn as our guides. We hiked down into the canyon a little (the girls ended up taking a 3 mile round trip hike). After doing a little shopping in the village and taking a family picture, we took off driving to the east and stopping several times along the way.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will never forget lunch that day. We pulled into a parking area and hiked about a mile off by ourselves and ate lunch cliff-side. It was chilly, but the view made everything about it perfect. Danny didn’t like getting that close to the edge, so he took pictures.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore bed, I did get a little reading in each day. After finishing The Big Rewind, I started Crazy Rich Asians. Much to the embarrassment of my kids, I took a picture of it at a stop after sneaking in a paragraph. I wasn’t able to finish Crazy Rich Asians on the plane ride back (we were up at 2:25 am to catch our first flight Saturday morning) because I slept during the first half. I did finish it before going back to work on Monday. It was a lot of fun. Just like The Big Rewind, it was a great book to bring along on vacation. I’m looking forward to reading the next book in the series, China Rich Girlfriend. Just knowing it exists is enough of a reason to plan another vacation.\\n\\nI hope everyone else’s spring has gotten off to as nice a start as mine has. I’m hoping to start posting more reviews, soon. After chatting with a reader via email earlier this week, I may just give the short blurbs a try on the blog, too. There’s no reason to keep them just to Litsy. Thanks for the inspiration, Marcia!\\n\\nHappy Wednesday!\\n\\nLike this:\\n\\nLike Loading...\\n', \"The Whiting began offering its seminars three years ago. “I suddenly had awful visions of our writers being on the hook for taxes at the end of a year that was supposed to offer them freedom,” said Courtney Hodell, the foundation’s director of writers’ programs. “The idea was to set up a space where creative people could ask questions of a professional who understands how writers live and work, talk frankly with one another about their issues and experiences around money, and generally neutralize the taboo that can keep people from making informed decisions.”\\n\\nAround the table, conversation was open, candid — part useful instruction, part pep talk, part encounter group. The writers spoke of confusion and angst surrounding many of the topics Ms. Smith covered, including student loans, mortgages, retirement, credit cards, poorly paying adjunct professorships and the dreaded I.R.S. Schedule C that self-employed people have to fill out.\\n\\n“When I was a poet living under the stairs in Brooklyn, I tried to be self-employed on my taxes,” Mr. Blanchfield said. (Like Harry Potter’s room at the Dursleys’ house, his studio apartment was, in fact, under the stairs.) One year, he said, he made something like $250 from his poetry but reported $4,500 in writing-related expenses, triggering a warning letter from the I.R.S. about a possible audit. “It made me really scared,” he said. (“There are a lot of ways to show that you are a legitimate professional writer,” Ms. Smith counseled. “Don’t let fear prevent you from deducting for expenses.”)\\n\\nAfter the session, several of the writers elaborated on their situations.\\n\\n“There’s a temptation to use magical money for magical purposes, to say, I should just throw the money up in the air and quit my job for a year and write my book,” said Alice Sola Kim, 32, who supports herself in part from her job as the executive assistant to a Columbia professor, writes short fiction and nonfiction for a variety of publications and is working on a novel. “But this has taught me there’s another way, too, that I can be prudent about the future.”\\n\\nLike many of the writers, Ms. Kim said she had a conflicted attitude toward money. She grew up without much in Seattle — her mother was frugal, but her father was profligate.\\n\\n“It can feel like this stuff just doesn’t apply to people who grow up poor or have been poor or don’t have a sense of money,” she said. “When you get money, you either hoard it like a dragon because you feel it’s not really real, or you spend it because you need to spend it. It doesn’t feel relevant to be thinking about things like Roth IRAs.”\\n\\nMitchell S. Jackson, 40 and the author of a novel and a book of essays and short stories, said that until recently he supported himself largely through teaching. At one time, he taught something like eight classes, paying between $1,800 and $5,500 each, at different colleges. He made a lot less than he had when he worked at his first job, dealing crack and other drugs as a teenager in Portland, Ore.\\n\\n“I don’t think I ever got it out of my mind how a drug dealer spends money,” he said, “which is really frivolous. It comes fast, and you spend it just as fast, and that’s set the tone. I know it’s not an entirely intelligent way to deal with my finances.”\\n\\nIn the seminar, Ms. Smith admonished the group members to refuse to work for nothing and to demand to be paid what their time and writing are worth.\\n\\n“Never say, ‘I usually get x, but … ’” she advised. “That means you’ve gone in apologizing. Always say, ‘My rate is y, what I need to charge is y.’ Just so it’s simple and clear, like when a plumber comes to your house to fix your sink.”\\n\\nMr. Blanchfield, whose latest work, a book of essays, comes out this week, said he had been particularly inspired by this concept.\\n\\n“It was like a great therapy session, in that she was saying that the right answer to anyone who wants you to work for less than you can live on, or do work that does not have a measurable gain for your writing career, is no,” he said. “The right answer is no! I thought that was pretty great.”\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on April 7, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Helping Writers With a Windfall Avoid a Downfall.

Men have written them and men have starred in them, because, for the most part, male soldiers have occupied the frontlines from Sparta to Verdun. In addition, men’s voices have been the dominant voices elsewhere in literature, why not in war?\\n\\nThis may have been the case with many of the classic war epics, where the literate among men left their homes and traveled to fight battles, while literate women were more likely to write on domestic and religious themes. But growing literacy has long since met more rapacious wars; Lebanon’s civil war, for instance, has been a topic for almost any author\\xa0who found themselves inside the country between 1975-1990.\\n\\nIs there a difference between men’s and women’s war stories?\\xa0The Arabic short story in WWB’s\\xa0April issue, “Mass Grave,” was written by US-based Iraqi author Faleeha Hassan and translated by William Hutchins. It is told from the point of view of a male soldier, and its interests are indistinguishable from those of a male writer. It is\\xa0somewhat distant from its material, lacking the immediate punch of a short story by Hassan Blasim or Mahmoud Saeed, but nonetheless focused squarely on a moment of (male) war.\\n\\nBut other Iraqi women writers do focus on\\xa0excavating women’s lives during conflic:\\xa0Duna Ghali’s recent\\xa0Orbits of Loneliness, for instance, describes\\xa0the narrator’s relationship to her young child both before and after the US invasion and occupation. Hadiya Hussein’s Beyond Love,\\xa0about those living in an emotional\\xa0no-man’s land after fleeing war.\\n\\nCertainly, the interest in women’s lives isn’t\\xa0just the province of women — Iraqi writer Ali Bader consciously focuses on women’s lives during war in his 2015 novel\\xa0Kaafira,\\xa0or\\xa0The Godless Woman.\\xa0But here, by women:\\n\\nLebanon’s Civil War: Hoda Barakat,\\xa0Stone of Laughter\\n\\nThere are dozens of women’s novels set in and around Lebanon’s 15-year civil war: Hanan al-Shaykh’s classic\\xa0The Story of Zahra;\\xa0Najwa Barakat Oh Salaam!\\xa0which explores how people go on (or don’t go on) with their lives after war; Alexandra Chrieteh’s anti-identitarian\\xa0Ali and His Russian Grandmother;\\xa0Etel Adnan’s passionate, feminist\\xa0Sitt Marie Rose;\\xa0Zeina Abirached’s graphic novel for young readers,\\xa0A Game for Swallows; Fatima Sharafeddine’s striking picture book\\xa0There is War in My City.\\n\\nBut Lebanese novelist Hoda Barakat nonetheless stands out as\\xa0one of the great authors of the war. She’s not interested, as she says, in “men who make history and the characters who believe in something.” She’s interested in the details of life during conflict, in digging underground, in seeing\\xa0the traces of life left behind by humans.\\n\\nBarakat\\xa0generally focuses most of her attention on male characters, and her writing\\xa0has even been called “anti-feminist.” But although it doesn’t focus on women’s lives,\\xa0The Stone of Laughter,\\xa0which centers on a gay protagonist, challenges the rigidities of gender construction\\xa0in a fresh, unburdened way.\\n\\nSyria, today: Rasha Abbas, The Gist of It\\n\\nThere are many women’s books about war in contemporary Syria, including two nonfiction books by Samar Yazbek that are available in English translation by Max Weiss (Woman in the Crossfire)\\xa0and\\xa0Nashwa Gowanlock and Ruth Ahmedzai Kemp (The Crossing).

You sat down on a wooden chair there once, right on the curbside, worn out from a show-off drinking binge that hadn’t made you look hard like it was meant to; a German tourist dabbed at your brow with a damp piece of cloth, saying “You’ll be all right,” in a scornful Germanic English voice. Then you got into a taxi with your broke friends and terrified them— you were so out of it that you actually launched into a mangled recitation of an Old Testament psalm in broken Hebrew (you had just about learned the basics of it) as the taxi driver stared distrustfully at you in the rearview mirror. “Give thanks to the Lord!” you said to him in Arabic, as if in response to his glares, then completed the line in your dodgy Hebrew “keiy . . . leiawlaam . . . khasdu” (“for his steadfast love endures forever”).\\n\\nPalestine, late 1940s: Sahar Khalifah’s\\xa0Of Noble Origins\\n\\nThis novel, trans.

Where only the masculine, invading force is available — only their stories of the 1830 invasion, for instance, have survived — Djebar uses them to tell her own story.\\n\\nLike this:\\n\\nLike Loading...\\n\\nCategories: war, women\\n', '\\xa0\\n\\nI’ve said this many times, but I love The Paris Review “Art of Fiction” interviews. They really are a fascinating look at famous authors.\\n\\nThe\\xa0interviewer always manages to get these writers to open up about their craft, and even their personal life to some extent.\\n\\nJoan Didion’s feature on The Paris Review was no exception. She talked about a variety of subjects, including female writers.\\xa0\\n\\nINTERVIEWER\\n\\nHave any women writers been strong influences?\\n\\nDIDION\\n\\nI think only in the sense of being models for a life, not for a style. I think that the Brontës probably encouraged my own delusions of theatricality. Something about George Eliot attracted me a great deal. I think I was not temperamentally attuned to either Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER\\n\\nWhat are the disadvantages, if any, of being a woman writer?\\n\\nDIDION\\n\\nWhen I was starting to write—in the late fifties, early sixties—there was a kind of social tradition in which male novelists could operate. Hard drinkers, bad livers. Wives, wars, big fish, Africa, Paris, no second acts. A man who wrote novels had a role in the world, and he could play that role and do whatever he wanted behind it. A woman who wrote novels had no particular role. Women who wrote novels were quite often perceived as invalids. Carson McCullers, Jane Bowles. Flannery O’Connor, of course. Novels by women tended to be described, even by their publishers, as sensitive. I’m not sure this is so true anymore, but it certainly was at the time, and I didn’t much like it. I dealt with it the same way I deal with everything. I just tended my own garden, didn’t pay much attention, behaved—I suppose—deviously. I mean I didn’t actually let too many people know what I was doing.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER\\n\\nAdvantages?\\n\\nDIDION\\n\\nThe advantages would probably be precisely the same as the disadvantages. A certain amount of resistance is good for anybody. It keeps you awake.\\n\\nINTERVIEWER\\n\\nCan you tell simply from the style of writing, or the sensibility, if the author is a woman?\\n\\nDIDION\\n\\nWell, if style is character—and I believe it is—then obviously your sexual identity is going to show up in your style. I don’t want to differentiate between style and sensibility, by the way. Again, your style is your sensibility. But this whole question of sexual identity is very tricky. If I were to read, cold, something by Anaïs Nin, I would probably say that it was written by a man trying to write as a woman. I feel the same way about Colette, and yet both those women are generally regarded as intensely “feminine” writers. I don’t seem to recognize “feminine.” On the other hand, Victory seems to me a profoundly female novel. So does Nostromo, so does The Secret Agent.\\n\\nI thought that last question was interesting.\\n\\nCan you tell whether a writer is a male or female by their style of writing? But, really, does it even matter? Do you guys care? I certainly don’t.

Well, friend, you needn’t book a flight to London just to check out a Waterstones. Alice Spawls went to one recently, and it wasn’t pretty: “Gifts now seem to take up as much space as books, at least on the tables, where the prettiest paperbacks are distributed among Orla Kiely pots and enamel cups … Something is working, because digital sales are down and those of paper and glue books are up, but the ephemera isn’t only disguising the books, it’s disguising the rise of the non-book book … Books can function as gift objects, lifestyle signifiers, thematic attributes; they can be non-book products too, word-based diversions, color-me distractions, bucket-lists, how-tos, extensions of celebrity brands. Putting something between two covers doesn’t make it a book, and putting them on shelves doesn’t make a bookshop.”\\n\\nPoor Kafka. Even beer, which many German men have turned to in times of need, proved fraught for him: “His most joyous—and meaningful—memories of beer were of the drinking sessions he shared with his father. But these memories were also inextricably allied with the twin sites of his childhood humiliation … [His father] Hermann was a blustering bully. But the deeper problem was that father and son had such different personalities, they were like slapstick antagonists. Hermann the confident and coarse shopkeeper vs. the timid Franz, who worked in insurance (Hermann derided it as a Brotberuf, or ‘bread job’), wrote weird stories in his room, became a vegetarian, and showed no interest whatsoever in the family dry goods store … The only time his father had a word of praise for him, wrote Kafka, was when ‘I was able to eat heartily or even drink beer with my meals’ … Beer made everything better.”\\n\\nChristina Crosby, a professor at Wesleyan, suffered a devastating bike accident that left her paralyzed. Her memoir A Body, Undone eschews the clichés of disability narratives; instead, as Michael Weinstein writes, Crosby lavishes “brutal detail on the pain of her post-accident body—of finding\\xa0her sphere of movement and sensation contracted down to almost nothing—and on the slow, excruciating process of navigating her quadriplegic body’s new limits. She describes waking to find her frame cobbled together and held in place by a man-made exoskeleton:\\xa0‘My mouth was full of metal, arch bars that ran from side to side to keep the roof of my mouth from caving in—somehow the bits of bone that had been my chin were pinned together, as were other bones in my face—and I wore a very high, tight, and rigid cervical collar around my neck. I could not turn my body or sit up. I could not move my legs or feet. I could not lift my arms or use my hands, which were uselessly curled up into loose fists by atrophying muscles and tightening ligaments.’ An entire chapter is devoted to describing Crosby’s bowel program, while half of another chapter discusses her intestinal gas.”\\n\\nJennifer Moxley on poetry, prizes, and poverty: “The poet needs money to live, but the poem needs only a reader. Which is more difficult to secure? In the history of the West, in some perverse way, a poet’s integrity has long been bound up with periodic privation, in love, in luck, in money. Publicare, the Latin root of the English ‘to publish,’ means also ‘to prostitute,’ to make public and ask money for what should remain private, whether your thoughts or your body. Perhaps the whiff of shame in making money from poetry comes from this etymological association, and drives poets to claim penury as their excuse.”\\n\\nTAGS beer, bookstores, Britain, Christina Crosby, disability, Franz Kafka, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Legos, money, poetry, prizes, Scandinavia\\n\\n\\n', 'The Iliad and The Odyssey loom large in European literary history and the tradition of epic poetry. Readers in both the ancient and modern worlds have been fascinated by the heroic exploits of Achilles and Odysseus and the idealized past the epics portray. Heinrich Schliemann was so taken by the events relayed in these Homeric epics that he sought to excavate the site of the Trojan War (Hisarlik, Turkey) that had been identified in 1822.\\n\\nAlthough a man named “Homer” was accepted in antiquity as the author of the poems, there is no evidence supporting the existence of such an author. By the late 1700s, careful dissection of the Iliad and Odyssey raised doubts about their composition by a single poet. Since then, scholars have used literary and archaeological evidence to address the “Homeric question,” which involves debates about the identity of Homer, authorship of the Homeric epics, and the historicity of the society depicted in them. Though aspects of this question remain hotly contested today, most scholars now accept that the poems are the product of a gradual process of oral dissemination.\\n\\nExplore more about the “Homeric question” and the influence of these epics in the infographic below.

They are dazzlingly complex,” says Samantha Ellis, author of How to Be a Heroine, over at the BBC. Great heroines are fiercely passionate, Ellis writes. “And maybe that is really why these heroines last, because they make our own long-buried feelings come to life.”\\n\\nRelated Posts:\\n', '\\n', \"The ultimate responsibility for the United States’ actions lies with an “oblivious” American public engrossed in “shallow digital enthusiasms and the worship of celebrity,” Bacevich writes. Americans support freedom, democracy and prosperity in other nations, he tells us, as long as they get the lion’s share of it. “Ensuring that Americans enjoy their rightful quota (which is to say, more than their fair share) of freedom, abundance and security comes first,” Bacevich says. “Everything else figures as an afterthought.”\\n\\nBacevich’s argument is heavy-handed at times, but when he writes about military strategy, he is genuinely incisive. Citing numerous examples, he convincingly argues that destructive myths about the efficacy of American military power blind policy makers, generals and voters. The use of overwhelming lethal force does not immediately cause dictators or terrorists to turn tail and run, even if that’s what politicians in Washington want to believe. Rather, it often leads to resentment, chaos and resistance.\\n\\nA presumption that using military power signified to friends and foes that Washington was getting serious about a problem diminished the role of diplomats and diplomacy. “\\u200a‘Getting serious’ also implied a preference for uniforms over suits as the principal agents of U.S. policy,” Bacevich writes. “Henceforth, rather than military power serving as the handmaiden of diplomacy, the reverse would be true.”\\n\\nIn another repeated mistake, triumphalist American commanders prematurely declare victory without realizing that their opponent has simply withdrawn to fight another day as a guerrilla force, as occurred in Afghanistan in 2001. They also personalize the enemy, wrongly assuming that the removal of figures like Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Muammar Qaddafi will instantly end conflict.\\n\\nFrom Somalia in 1993 to Yemen today, American commanders and policy makers overestimated the advantage American military technology bestows on them. And most crucially of all, the United States has failed to decide whether it is, in fact, at war.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the war for the greater Middle East, the United States chose neither to contain nor to crush, instead charting a course midway in between,” Bacevich writes. “Instead of intimidating, U.S. military efforts have annoyed, incited and generally communicated a lack of both competence and determination.” The historical forces at work in the Middle East are different from the dynamics that led to American victories in World War II and the Cold War. American officials have failed to understand that. What’s more, a deluded Washington foreign policy establishment believes that an American way of life based on “consumption and choice” will be accepted over time in the “Islamic world.”\\n\\nBut it is here, in his description of the “Islamic world,” that Bacevich stumbles. What is missing in this book about “the greater Middle East” are the people of the greater Middle East. Bacevich’s most highly developed Muslim character in these pages is Saddam Hussein. The former Afghan president Hamid Karzai is a distant second. Beyond those two, the rest of the world’s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims come across as two-dimensional caricatures.\\n\\nAnd so Bacevich lumps together vastly different nationalities — from Bosnians to Iraqis to Somalis — often referring to all of them primarily as “Muslims.” The dizzying complexities of each country’s history, politics, culture, resources and rivalries are missing. And when it comes to how “Muslims” view the world, Bacevich veers into the simplistic essentialism that he accuses Washington policy makers of following.\\n\\nBacevich suggests that in the “Islamic world” lifestyles based on “consumption and choice” might not work. Such broad-brush statements might well be considered simplistic and even bigoted if applied to other faiths. Can one contend that a “Christian world,” “Hindu world” or “Jewish world” exists? Are such generalizations analytically useful? Do the world’s hundreds of millions of Muslims practice their faith identically?\\n\\nAs a result of this essentialism, Bacevich glosses over a vital point about the Middle East today: A historic and brutal struggle between radicals and modernists for the future of the region is underway. One can argue that the United States has no place in that fight, but making sweeping generalizations about Muslims as Bacevich does limits our understanding of the forces at work in the region. It also plays into the hands of extremists who seek to divide the world by faith.\\n\\nIn the most troubling passage of the book, Bacevich breezily questions pluralism itself. “According to one of the prevailing shibboleths of the present age, this commingling of cultures is inherently good,” he writes. “It fosters pluralism, thereby enriching everyday life. Yet cultural interaction also induces friction, whether spontaneously generated or instigated by demagogues and provocateurs.”\\n\\nWe do live in a dangerous world, but it is also an inevitably interconnected one. The commingling of cultures cannot be stopped. Nor should it be.\\n\\nFor all that, Bacevich is right that the United States’ reflexive use of armed intervention in the Middle East is folly. An unquestioning faith in military might and an underinvestment in diplomacy has tied Washington in a policy straitjacket. Bacevich’s call for Americans to rethink their nation’s militarized approach to the Middle East is incisive, urgent and essential.\\n\\nDavid Rohde is the national security investigations editor for Reuters and a contributing editor for The Atlantic. \\n\\nA version of this review appears in print on April 17, 2016, on page BR17 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Perils of Triumphalism.

There are giant bugs and snakes and river monsters. There is fashion. There’s a dingy spaceship and futuristic gambling. There’s a brooding bad boy who isn’t too bad and a very sweet ingénue who totally kicks ass. There’s a fluffy alien pet with three rows of teeth – like a super snuggly, deadly cat. The cover has pink AND fuchsia. You can’t ask for much more from life than this.\\n\\nThe hero of this story is named Teague Severance, because of course he is, and he is a Wolf (not literally). Wolves are basically regular human beings, although Severance really plays up the “Wolf” moniker – he’s a loner with a lot of aggression. He’s very rugged and cynical; you know the type. Cidra, the heroine, wants Severance to let her earn her passage on his cargo ship. Cidra was born to two Harmonics – people who, in contrast to Wolves, achieve great serenity and perfect telepathic communication. Cidra has the cultural traits of Harmonics, but lacks the telepathic skills. She hopes that if she travels enough, she’ll find a key to unlocking those skills so that she can become a true Harmonic. Commence intergalactic road trip and romance between opposites!\\n\\nI had great fears about this book because the 1986 edition features an inside front page blurb from the publisher with these inspiring words, “I didn’t rape you, Cidra.” Good heavens. I can’t think of worse words with which to advertise a book. In my experience, generally when someone says, “I didn’t rape you” what they mean is “I totally raped you I’m just choosing not to think of it that way because I’m an asshole.”\\n\\nIt is with vast relief that I inform you all that all the sex in this book is consensual. Severance’s comment has to do with his fear that Cidra might not be able to handle the intensity of sex after the fact, and that she might be blaming him for the sex, but Cidra is always quite sex-positive, to Severance’s mingled delight and chagrin:\\n\\nHarmonics in general don’t seem very interested in sex, as we both know. Once I am one, I will also probably lose interest. In the meantime, there is something to be learned, and last night I had a sudden, unexpected interest in learning.\\n\\nOh, Cidra, how I adore you. Cidra could be an impossible character, too good for this saintly earth, if not for the fact that she’s so funny and so tough. Cidra comes from an incredibly sheltered environment, one almost devoid of conflict. The Harmonic ideal is one of calm, formality, and mental communion as opposed to physical intimacy (of any kind – even her parents never hug her). As soon as she leaves home she finds herself in the middle of bar fights, and searching through abandoned temples, and learning to gamble, and hunting small animals when necessary for survival (although she never stops being vegetarian under normal circumstances).\\n\\nThe very first time someone attacks Cidra, she knocks the guy out. It’s her first fight. Severance rushes in to save her and finds her standing over the unconscious body of her foe:\\n\\n“What, exactly, did you do?”\\n\\n“It’s called Moonlight and Mirrors. It’s a kind of dance. An exercise, really. But it’s based on a very old self-defense technique. My instructors always said I had a unique style of interpretation,” she added lamely.\\n\\nThe scene sums up a lot of the tone of the book – it’s funny, but there’s real menace in the attack. Cidra and Severance both assume that she’s going to be dependent on him, given his expertise in the Wolf culture, but Cidra can actually stand up for herself very efficiently.\\n\\nThis book\\xa0has a fun pulp science fiction quality to it when Cidra and Severance crash land on a hostile jungle planet. I loved the action and the mystery and the humor, and the scenes of Cidra and Severance hanging out on the spaceship. The pacing is excellent – there are enough action scenes to keep the book moving, and enough quiet scenes to allow for believable character development. Cidra is a more complex and compelling character than Severance, but the two characters play off each other in an incredibly entertaining way.\\n\\nBy the end of the book, not only did I want these two crazy kids to wind up together, but I could picture their future lives. Sometimes in romance there’s so much keeping two characters apart that the couple’s resolution seems overly optimistic. In this book, I understood the conflict, but by the end Cidra in particular had become such a tough, shrewd spacefarer, without losing her core values and personality, that I could totally picture her and Severance flying side by side. And while Cidra will keep pants and a shirt handy (she found them very helpful for jungle hiking), I’m sure for the most part she’ll be wearing fantastic clothes of “delicate yellow-gold fabric spun of the finest crystal moss.”\\n\\nYou just can’t beat crystal moss for fashion and style, or so I hear from the Harmonics.\\n\\nThis book is available from:\\n\\n1986\\n', 'One of my favorite sonnets by Shakespeare is number 50, for the circuitry between rider and horse on this woeful journey, its sounds that mimic a sad plodding, an image that encapsulates so much of the poem’s pain, its invisible impetus, and its solemn mood, which will not relent.\\n\\nThe image of an hourglass – sand streaming down, glass tipped to begin again, the fluidity of that back and forth – comes to mind when I picture the speaker upon his horse, that poor beast bearing human burden, human woe, human weight, who then is spurred, not to move faster, but out of human anger. The horse’s groan of physical pain is felt in the rider’s mind, and there is no salve for either. Horse and man, flesh and emotion, are bound together as one circuit of pain, testing the limit of what can be borne, until it is met and released through wound and sound.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSonnet 50\\n\\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\\nWhen what I seek, my weary travel’s end,\\nDoth teach that ease and that repose to say,\\n‘Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!’\\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\\nHis rider lov’d not speed being made from thee.\\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side;\\nFor that same groan doth put this in my mind,\\nMy grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHow heavily the poem begins, the words ‘heavy,’ ‘journey,’ ‘way,’ filled with such weight that to read them aloud mimics the plodding steps. A faint respite is in the second line with the word ‘seek’ (that light, searching word), only to return, heavily, with ‘weary travel’s end.’ These three words seem exhausted. And we’re still only at the beginning.\\n\\nAlong the lines of word invoking mood, ‘provoke’ seems itself so spur-like. The p a soft leaning against horseflesh, the r digging in harder, the sharpness of the v and k like metal teeth, the o and o of the held center. Doesn’t the word seem so much like a little spur?\\n\\nAnd what precedes this rich ‘provoke’ is the masterful image of the bloody spur, which, encapsulates so well the grief, the soreness, the banal pain of this journey. The blood belongs to the horse, yes, with the spur being pain’s medium, but the blood seems also to belong to the rider, since man and animal are fused throughout. I adore the vividness of this bloody spur, how visible it is in the poem’s center and in my mind.\\n\\nAs a counterpart, what (or who) is invisible is also essential, this ‘friend,’ that ‘joy’ left miles ago. Nowhere and yet everywhere, source of anguish and tension, that estrangement of love-left-behind looms with every step of the poem.\\n\\nI appreciate this poem’s mood of despair, which does not lift. I love its slow insistence, which mirrors the action within it: there is nothing but grief to reach. There is no happy ending, yet it moves forward with a steadiness and nobility that is moving.\\n\\nI’m returning to this poem after completing a collection of poems based on Japanese Edo-period (1603-1868) artworks. One inspirational painting was ‘Young Samurai on Horseback’ by Okumura Masanobu. Depicted is a young man on his decorated horse, getting ready to leave for war, with two women whispering behind a window in the house he is leaving. His isolation is palpable, as is the horse’s impatience. I think about this man in contrast to Shakespeare’s rider, who is instead in the middle of his journey, and it seems that there is no more tortuous, more downtrodden place to be then en route, with all of that time to think and feel above the hoof-beats.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nImage\\xa0©\\xa0Rembrandt \\n', '\\n\\n\\nDC Comics Female Characters: INFOGRAPHIC\\n\\nBy Maryann Yin\\xa0on Apr. 20, 2016 - 3:10 PMComment\\n\\nWho’s your favorite female character from the DC Comics universe?

Tributes pour\\xa0in: Minnesota Public Radio has dedicated its waves exclusively to the artist; purple rain adorns next week’s New Yorker cover; San Francisco lit its City Hall with the royal hue; and MTV, who hasn’t played a music video in years, aired nothing but the late musician’s work and his movie, “Purple Rain,” yesterday. “His music was a cornucopia of ideas: triumphantly, brilliantly kaleidoscopic.”\\n\\nAs it turns out, Soviet production novels, that humorless subgenre of yore, followed a pretty basic pattern: “an outsider arrives at a factory or construction site and has to figure out how to solve a morale problem or increase productivity: Ivan Alexandrovich has to supervise the building of a hydroelectric plant or Sofia Alexandrovna has to increase production at the textile mill. They are, along with Elizabethan masques and vice-presidential autobiographies, one of the most arid literary genres ever devised.”\\n\\nAny young person working in publishing today ought to know a little about the history of\\xa0fonts. If you, like me, feel your knowledge is lacking, I offer you a not-so-brief history of roman fonts. “The Carolingian or Caroline minuscule joined forces with antique Roman square capitals at the very beginning of the fifteenth century—a conjunction willed by the great Florentine humanists; their forms first wrought in metal by two German immigrants at Subiaco and Rome, honed by a Frenchman, and consummated at the hands of Griffo of Bologna and Aldus the Venetian. A thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire, the romans returned and re-conquered.”\\n\\nToday is the four-hundredth anniversary of Cervantes’s death. Before he wrote Don Quixote,Cervantes was kidnapped by pirates and imprisoned in the Algiers for five years, a life-defining moment that influenced his writing: “I would argue that Cervantes’s explicit interest in the question of madness emerges from the borderline situations he endured as a captive, from the encounter with death that transformed him into a survivor. [It] converts him into a pioneer in the exploration of the psyche three centuries before Freud.”\\n\\nYou know who else passed away this week four-hundred years ago? Shakespeare. To celebrate The Bard, NPR spoke with Shakespeare scholars, dramaturges, and Victorian food experts to bring you a series of delightful essays on his\\xa0relation to food, which have surprising linguistic and gastronomical insights: “When Hamlet huffs about the ‘funeral baked meats’ served at his mother's wedding banquet, he is chastising her for her quick re-marriage, implying that she was serving leftovers from his father's recent funeral. But funeral baked meats were in fact a real food, and they weren't as macabre as their name implied—though they were cooked in a ‘coffin.’ The same word was used for “a coffer to keep dead people or to keep meat in,” explains Ken Albala, director of food studies at the University of the Pacific. But these edible coffins, he explains, were made of pastry crust to to seal the contents so that they lasted longer. Because that pastry was built to act\\xa0more like Tupperware\\xa0than a treat, it was coarse and tossed rather than eaten.”\\n\\nTAGS Don Quixote, Fonts, food, funeral baked meats, Hamlet, imprisonment, memorial, Miguel de Cervantes, music, NPR, pirates, Prince, purple, Shakespeare, Soviet, typography\\n\\n\\n\", 'Essential books of poetry by Latino authors\\xa0selected by Times Critic-at-Large Rigoberto González\\n\\nListed alphabetically by author and editor\\n\\nFrancisco X.

I’d walk around New York with no particular aim, trekking from my job in midtown to a subway station in SoHo because I had nowhere better to be. I took my lunch (one-dollar coffee, banana) in the bakery across the street from my shitty office, where I’d read and smoke (indoors!). I was broke, but buying things made me feel alive. I’d pick up remainders at Coliseum Books, or vintage porn from a sidewalk vendor on Seventh Avenue. One day, on a whim, I bought Ono’s 1982 album It’s Alright (I See Rainbows). It was, perhaps unsurprisingly, on sale.\\n\\nIf I didn’t like Yoko Ono myself, I might think someone who called himself a fan was joking, or engaged in some other thing: adolescent contrarianism or camp, possibly diva worship of those giant Porsche sunglasses, those hats, those short shorts, those gams, the incontrovertible foreignness of Ono’s English. For a long time Ono was basically despised, the inevitable lot of someone married to a person whose fame actually may have eclipsed Christ’s. Fools hate foreigners, and fools hate women, but a lot of people who ought to know better hate the avant-garde, and a lot of people who ought to know better hate the politically engaged, and a lot of people who ought to know better hate polymaths, and Ono is all those things. I think that now the line among sophisticates is that Ono’s musical project is so idiosyncratic you can respect it without quite enjoying it, but I’ve never considered myself a sophisticate.\\n\\nI associate Yoko Ono’s music with our first year of George W. Bush’s ruinous presidency, prophetess for a new year/decade/century/millennium. That September morning, I watched smoke pluming up over the Williamsburg Savings Bank (then dentist’s offices, now luxury condominiums) from my bedroom window. I strolled through Fort Greene Park, where people, no doubt driven mad by watching television, were playing tennis. That night, I listened to Ono’s album Rising, on headphones connected to my Discman.\\n\\nThat album was suited to that day: war has long been one of Ono’s abiding preoccupations, and war was in the air. “Towns burning/ Throats choking/ Watch out/ Check out.” Indeed, I did check out. I left New York to live alone in a big empty house in the woods, where I spent months writing five hundred pages of a truly horrible novel and listening to Rising repeatedly. I had no television, I had one book (The Ambassadors, for some stupid reason), and I had nightmares almost nightly. Ono entertained me. “You are a New York Woman/ I miss you/ I miss you/ I miss you, my friend,” she sang, and it seemed like she was talking about the women who would have been my friends, if I had any.\\n\\nOn one of the album’s later songs, “Where Do We Go From Here,” Ono sings, “Are we getting tired of blood and horror? Are we getting ready for God and terror?” That Rising was released in 1996 makes Ono seem prescient. I went back to New York in the spring of 2002 and found it so full of God and terror that I couldn’t take the subway, and broke down into tears when a lunatic at Pathmark called me a faggot. I never finished writing that novel.\\n\\nIt probably means I’m a philistine that I never simply listen to music; it’s a secondary consideration, something to accompany me on a commute, while washing dishes, on those rare horrible occasions I decide to go for a run. I respond to music emotionally rather than intellectually, which feels like a failing, if a common one. At some point a couple of years ago, I trained myself to write at night instead of during the day; it was easier to sustain focus after the children were asleep, and I was tired all the time because of the children anyway. I used music to modulate those late nights, giving those hours a rhythm: easy, then invigorating, then calming.\\n\\nThat nightly cycle almost always involved revisiting that first record of Ono’s I had bought. “My Man” is a daffy, earnest love song that’s almost certainly about John Lennon\\xa0(“When he speaks/ all the birds come around”). It’s sung, rather than screamed — the notion of Ono as banshee isn’t an altogether fair one\\xa0—\\xa0and it calmed me. “Spec of Dust,” another song that’s probably about Lennon, a paean to the idea that love is timeless, made me sad. “Why do I miss you so/ if you’re just a spec of dust/ floating, endlessly, amongst a billion stars?”\\n\\nThat record, with its songs of love and rage, made me remember being a dumb twenty-something, full of both: love for some theoretical boyfriend, rage at my creative/financial/professional impotence. Most feel this way as teens and get into punk rock or start a shitty band all their own, but I had an arrested adolescence, not uncommon, I think, when you grow up gay but refuse to think about it, and so I had Yoko Ono. Listening to her in my thirties, in the middle of the night, my husband and children asleep upstairs, I remembered the years in which I was without a husband, without children, and without the discipline to write a book.\\n\\nI love hearing people’s advice about books to read, exhibitions to attend, films to see, but I am utterly incurious about what music people recommend, because I ask that music perform this service for me, that it entertain me in the moment while also offering some memory of a moment long passed. Dionne Warwick reminds me of those early days of parenthood, my older son lolling around on a blanket and frowning; Kate Bush’s sixth record reminds me so much of a desperate summer I spent lovelorn in Boston that I can barely bear to listen to it. It’s an imperfect way of listening, of consuming, of course; emotions ruin everything.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThere are the songs I enjoy because they remind me of some previous time, some previous self, and there are the songs I enjoy because they are tidy, perfect texts of which I am professionally jealous. Ono has always had a flair for language. Undoubtedly her best-known work is the phrase “War is Over! If You Want It,” a line in “Happy Xmas,” the song she co-wrote with her late husband, but more famously the advertising slogan of Yoko Ono Inc., on behalf of all humanity, stark black on pure white in filthy Times Square.\\n\\nThere’s an unadorned clarity to her writing, which might have something to do with her long association with Fluxus, the self-serious art movement that preferred strong words and uncollectable action and performance to a traditional conception of art. The movement was big on disarming straight talk. Ono’s book Grapefruit is pure Fluxus: silly and impossible instructions for actions, process as product. I love that you still see pretty undergrads buying copies of it at the Strand every fall. This is why Ono is so great at Twitter, a medium where she has had a renaissance — she’s been able to talk directly to an audience that might otherwise not know much about her beyond the obvious.\\n\\nOno’s oeuvre contains many turns of phrase that I envy — one of my favorite songs is her “All Day Long I Felt Like Smashing My Face in a Clear Glass Window” which has the very clarity that makes her tweets, and Grapefruit, so perfect. Her songs are poetry that never sound much like poetry, unlike many of Morrissey’s songs, which I can never listen to when I work because I end up writing ersatz Smiths lyrics, with opaque references to the royal family.\\n\\nBut of course the real standard by which you measure a song is more animal than intellectual. In the story “Signs and Symbols,” Nabokov wrote of referential mania, the delusion that all the world — the most innocuous action, the simple existence of some thing — is somehow about you. I imagine we all suffer from this mania when it comes to judging art (hence this passion to see ourselves in the pages of a book) but of course, there’s some other, ineffable thing to the equation. Ono has written a lot of great songs. She’s also written a lot of not great songs, as have most people engaged in this pursuit. The sound of some of Ono’s songs — “She Gets Down on Her Knees,” “I Have a Woman Inside My Soul,” “Loneliness,” “Sisters O Sisters” — simply works for me; music and the savage beast and all that.\\n\\nOno can and does caterwaul, and I get why people snicker at that. It’s aggressive and weird and disorienting and to laugh at it is an obvious response, if a superficial one. The live version of “Don’t Worry Kyoko,” on Ono’s 1972 record with Lennon, Some Time in New York City, is bracing, electric, astonishing. You needn’t know the backstory — Kyoko is Ono’s daughter, the subject of a custody dispute so bitter they were wholly separated for decades — to hear the raw expression of pain leavened by maternal comfort in Ono’s screams. In the soundtrack to Ono’s remarkably unsettling short film “Fly,” she delivers a vocal performance that defies description. It’s worth listening to, even if you can only manage to listen to it once; I think the same can be fairly said of the composer Kaija Saariaho or many other difficult artists. But leave aside this aggressively avant-garde work if you like; “The Death of Samantha” and “Walking on Thin Ice” are great rock and roll songs. It’s incredible to me that the same artist could manage to have made both.\\n\\n*\\n\\nMy children are older now, and I’ve gone soft, the abbreviated schedule of their infant sleep somehow forgotten. A few weeks ago, I tried to reclaim the night for myself, those stretches of hours that had proved so fertile, so essential, only a couple of years ago. It was in part superstition and in part the simple need to keep myself awake, but I tried to recreate the specific rhythm of those productive nights: ease, then energy, then quietude. I began with the Brandenberg Concertos, but Bach’s cool mathematics often make me sleepy. I played “Don’t Worry Kyoko,” to rouse myself, then the computer offered me “Is Winter Here to Stay?,” a song of Ono’s that I’ve long liked. I was surprised to find that what I remembered, with a sensory clarity that was almost frightening, was not that time alone in a far-away house in 2001 but a similar night alone in the house I still call home. I remembered two years ago, I remembered a tumbler of watery whisky, damp with condensation, the oppressive heat of New York in June, the lack of absolute silence even at two o’clock in the morning, the reassuring sense that everyone I loved was asleep upstairs.\\n\\nIt’s a confounding thing that art can endure. I don’t mean over the ages — what does that matter, we’re destroying the planet — but in our lives. Art is a conversation between you and someone you’ve probably never met, and that conversation can continue for so long. Yoko Ono, who once reminded me of being twenty-three and watching the world blow up, now reminds me of being thirty-six, old enough to have built a world anew for myself. I don’t know why this should be, but I’m grateful that it is. When she screams don’t worry, I almost believe her.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nImage:\\xa0I bought this oddity on eBay in the middle of the night. It purports to be a wire service news bulletin, and I can’t imagine it’s not authentic because who would fake such a thing? The manner in which Ono is discussed in this says a great deal. I like to imagine Ono, who has played with language throughout her long career, would be amused at rather than hurt by its casual cruelty. It’s dated the day after John Lennon was murdered.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n', '\\n', 'Thoughts on this year’s Hugo finalists (the list of which you can find here):\\n\\n* First, as part of my new gig at the Los Angeles Times, I wrote an analysis of this year’s ballot there, so head on over there if you want to see it (Note it’s geared toward a general audience, so there a lot of explanatory stuff in there folks here will likely already know). As I’ve already written substantially on the Hugos there, what I write here will be brief.\\n\\n* Overall, the nominations in several categories look pretty decent to me – Best Novel is particularly not bad at all! At least a couple of categories are a tiresome shitshow, however, thanks to the Puppies, again.\\n\\n* Which we knew might happen again, remember? Fixing the slating issue was a two-year process. This is year two. Keep working on it, folks.\\n\\n* The Puppies are once again trying to troll a bunch of people (the Best Related Category is one particularly obvious troll) and while I don’t mean to downplay the basic craptasticness of their actions, I’m finding it all that difficult to get worked up about it. I mean, I know the Puppies are hoping for outrage? Again? But as noted, we’ve seen this act before, and this time it’s just boring. Yes, yes, Puppies. You’re still sad little bigoted assholes screaming for attention. Got it, thanks.\\n\\nBear in mind I’m a direct target for their nonsense; at least two of the finalist works go after me in one way or another. I’m very specifically someone they’re trying to get worked up (and to tear down). And yet I just can’t manage it. I’m pretty much over the Puppies. There’s only so many times a toddler\\xa0can throw a tantrum before you just shrug. You still have to clean up after the toddler, mind you. But you don’t have to let the toddler dictate the terms. Pity these particular toddlers are grown humans.\\n\\nAaaand that’s about all the energy I’m willing to expend on the Puppies this year: A tiny bit of pity, and then consideration of the things on the finalist ballot worth my time\\xa0– which, fortunately, there are several, and would have been no matter what the Pups did.\\n', \"Katie Ruggle's new romantic suspense novel, Hold Your Breath, starts with heroine Lou Sparks landing in hot water—no, make that very cold water—as she trains for ice rescue in a frozen reservoir in Colorado. And then she finds a dead body in the reservoir.\\n\\nThe first in Ruggle's search-and-rescue series,\\xa0Hold Your Breath combines suspense with humor as Lou and her rescue-squad boss, Callum, first spar and then team up to find the murderer. In the meantime, someone is targeting Lou. Is it the killer? Is it someone else with a grudge against her?\\n\\nYou know what to do. Read it and find out. But before you do, see what Katie Ruggle has to say about ice rescue, small towns, and crafting suspense in remote locations.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAmazon Book Review: Your heroine, Lou Sparks, has moved to an off-the-grid cabin in Colorado after leaving her more affluent life in Connecticut behind her. What about Lou and her fresh start do you think readers will find appealing?\\n\\nKatie Ruggle: I imagine almost everyone has thought, at some time or another, “I hate my job/school/relationship/life. I’m running away to the mountains/beach/island/Cleveland.” (Okay, maybe not the last one.) For most, these escape plans never get past the daydream stage, but Lou actually did it. She left life as she knew it behind and moved to a tiny, off-grid, scarily remote cabin. How wonderful and terrifying is that?\\n\\nLou admits to Callum in Hold Your Breath that she didn’t even know how to light a fire before she arrived in Simpson. The only heat source in her cabin is her wood stove. In order to not freeze to death, she had to figure it out—fast. Lou’s first winter in the mountains is a story of survival, of learning everything she needs to know in order to hold onto her newfound independence. Not only does she stay alive, but she thrives—and she never loses her sense of humor. I think readers will be drawn to Lou’s courage and tenacity as she struggles not only to keep herself alive, but to help others as part of the rescue dive team.\\n\\nHold Your Breath opens with Lou going through ice-rescue training—and she uses that training later in a critical scene. You yourself have been certified in ice rescue. How often have you had to use that training in real life? \\n\\nUnfortunately (or maybe fortunately? That water is cold!), I haven’t used the training as much as I’d have liked. After becoming certified, it started to snow…and snow and snow. I was living off-grid in the mountains at the time (although my system was not as bare-bones as Lou’s; I’m a big believer in backup plans—and backup generators). As the wind howled and the snow hardened into rock-like drifts, I developed a new understanding of the term “cabin fever.”\\n\\nSeveral times, when the plow would finally, finally pass by my house, I was tempted to run out and wave down the driver, just so I could talk face-to-face with a real, live person. By exercising a huge amount of willpower, I managed to resist plow-chasing.\\n\\nSince I was stuck in my house for weeks at a time, it was impossible to get to the fire station for training or to go on calls. Now that I’m in Minnesota, I’m planning to volunteer for the local fire department and dust off my ice-rescue skills as soon as I find a spare minute. With its multitude of lakes and the frigid winter temperatures, I’m thinking that Minnesota will offer plenty of opportunities for me to jump into cold water (um…yay?).\\n\\n Lou and Callum seem to have an opposites-attract relationship, but they’re both committed to helping others. What else do they have in common that gives their romance a solid foundation?\\n\\nDespite their differences regarding, say, the cleanliness of their pickups or their window-blind-hanging techniques, Lou and Callum respect each other. They are both smart, courageous, strong people, and they know that these positive traits are what matter. The little things—like Lou’s chaos-causing tendencies or Cal’s insistence on arranging the firewood in a very specific, very orderly way—are insignificant—endearing, even. They truly like one another, and that’s a pretty sturdy foundation for a relationship.\\n\\nThe details of the murder aren't resolved by the end of Hold Your Breath, so clearly we’re going to return to Colorado to find out more. Whose story is next in the series, or will you continue to explore the evolution of Lou and Callum’s relationship in the next book?\\n\\nAlthough Lou and Callum show up quite a bit in Fan the Flames, the second book in the series, they won’t be the main players. Firefighter and MC member Ian, along with gun-shop owner Rory, will take center stage in this one. Doing research on this book was a blast (ha! Please excuse my unintentional pun); my inner gun nerd had such a great time.\\n\\nWhat aspects of a small town in the Rockies made it the perfect setting for your search-and-rescue series?\\n\\nI love writing about small towns. There’s something so comforting—yet claustrophobic—about places where everyone knows everyone else’s business. The setting plays a huge part in building suspense, too. After I moved to the Colorado Rockies, it took me a while to truly understand the meaning of the word “remote.” In the city where I’d previously been living, the average response time for first responders (police, ambulance or firefighters) was six minutes. In my new mountain home, it was seventeen—and that was on a good day. When there was a blizzard and/or icy roads and/or closed mountain passes and/or a herd of bighorn sheep hanging out on the highway, this response time could be stretched even longer.\\n\\nIt’s scary enough to hear someone trying to break into your home when you’re in the middle of civilization. You can call 9-1-1, and the police will be there in a handful of minutes. You can scream, and your more helpful and/or nosy neighbors will be there in seconds. Help is close and plentiful.\\n\\nBut what if you’re alone in a mountain cabin with a bad guy at the door? You try to call, but there’s no cell reception. You scream, but only the burglar and the coyotes can hear you. There’s no help. There’s just you—and the bad guy.\\n\\nScary, right? And that’s why it’s a perfect setting for a romantic suspense.\\n\\nWhat have you read lately that you’ve been recommending to friends or other readers?\\n\\nWith trying to squeeze writing and editing into the small window between a night baking job and sleep, I’ve sadly fallen behind in my reading. However, I did manage to cram in\\xa0The Wall of Winnipeg and Me by Mariana Zapata. After staying up all day reading, I was a bread-making zombie the next night, but the book was totally worth the sleep deprivation. I love her characters so very much.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nYou might also like:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSubscribe to Omnivoracious: The Amazon Book Review for our picks of best books of the month, author interviews, reading recommendations, and more from the Amazon Books editors\\n\\nShop this article on Amazon.com\\n\", '\\n\\t\\tCongratulations to Eight Emerging Arabic Novelists Who Won 2016 AFAC\\xa0Grants \\t\\n\\n\\nBy mlynxqualey on April 28, 2016\\t• ( 0 )\\n\\n\\nEight novelists writing in Arabic have won 2016 grants from the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture (AFAC) to work with the acclaimed, award-winning Lebanese novelist Jabbour Douaihy on a fiction project:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authors — from Egypt (2), Morocco, Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen, and Tunisia (2) — will work on various projects under the guidance of leading Lebanese novelist Jabbour Douaihy.\\n\\nYou can read more about their projects in Arabic and English at the AFAC website.\\n\\nPrevious AFAC literary grantees include Sahar Mandour (Mina), whose\\xa032\\xa0is available in English translation from Nicole Fares; Inaam Kachachi, whose grant-winning\\xa0Tashaari\\xa0was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction; Hilal Chouman, whose\\xa0Limbo Beirut\\xa0will be released in translation this fall, by Anna Ziajka Stanton; award-winning Egyptian short story writer Tareq Emam; acclaimed Iraqi playwright and short-story writer Hassan Blasim; Iman Humaydan,\\xa0whose latest novel will be available this fall in translation by Michelle Hartman; and others.\\n\\nThe AFAC Novel Writing Program\\xa0“is a new intensive year-long training program offered by AFAC in lieu of the annual grant for literature as a response for the need to offer professional support to aspiring authors in the Arab region.

Lovecraft. In fact, Book Riot has written about awesome Lovecraftian-inspired work before.\\n\\n2016, though, is feeling especially tentacular.\\n\\nCase in point: this year brings not one, but two reimaginings of Lovecraft’s tales: The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor LaValle, a retelling of The Horror at Red Hook, and The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe, a re-imagining of The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath out in August.\\n\\nThere’s also a funny — and disturbing — murder mystery about the Lovecraft fandom, I Am Providence, by Nick Mamatas, due out in August, and Hammers on Bone, a Lovecraftian noir by Cassandra Khaw, coming out in October. And if we want to cheat a little, Ruthanna Emrys’ Winter Tide, a follow-up to her novelette The Litany of Earth, (a re-imagining of The Shadow Over Innsmouth) will be out just after this year ends, in January 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nDude, that’s a lot of Elder Things.\\n\\nThe re-imaginings speak to me most most strongly, particularly when you look at the authors doing the re-telling. It’s important that people of color and women, who were respectively demonized and ignored in Lovecraft’s work, present their own takes on ol’ Howie’s canon.\\n\\nHow do the retellings stand up to the originals? I’m glad you asked. Here’s a look at Black Tom, Vellitt Boe, and Litany of Earth, as well as the original stories they’re drawn from.\\n\\n(WARNING: If you haven’t read the original Lovecraft stories, here be spoilers.)\\n\\nThe Ballad of Black Tom, a retelling of The Horror At Red Hook\\n\\nThe original:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Horror at Red Hook: A New York City detective, Malone, has been investigating the mental health of a rich man named Robert Suydam, who has been hanging out with the immigrants of Red Hood. (Oh no!) Suydam clears his name, however, and everything seems fine until he moves to Red Hook to live with the immigrants. Kids start disappearing, and then Suydam shows up, looking suspiciously younger. Blue-eyed children keep disappearing, and an army of dark-skinned immigrants appear in Red Hook. Suydam is clearly leading this army in some infernal task, and Malone is going to get to the bottom of it.\\n\\nThe retelling: \\n\\nThe Ballad of Black Tom: Charles Thomas Tester is a 20-year-old\\xa0 living in Harlem. He’s approached by a strange old white man named Robert Suydam, who asks him to play guitar at a party. Suydam introduces Tom to the Cthulu mythos, telling him that Cthulu will help the oppressed people of the Earth. Suydam’s plan is to wake the Elder Ones and rule his dark-skinned army as a king, but Tom knows better than to trust him.\\nThis book not only gives Tom, who isn’t mentioned in the original story (because none of Lovecraft’s POC ever had identities or agency), a voice and a face, but LaValle also gives the people of Red Hook their humanity back. Yes, the crowd that follows Suydam is rough and villainous, but the people who live in Red Hook are being used and brutalized, both by Suydam and the police. Malone, meanwhile, is well-meaning, but clueless and bigoted, and there’s even a Lovecraft cameo.\\n\\nThe Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe, a re-imagining of The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\\n\\nThe original:\\n\\nThe Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath: Randolph Carter has twice dreamed of a marvelous city only to have the vision snatched away from him. As an experienced dreamer, he decides to go into the dreamworld consciously to find his city. His quest takes him to Ulthar, a town filled with cats, to the forest of the zoogs, the underground city of the gugs, and to the Leng plateau where the gods have mated with the local population. But he can’t find the gods anywhere. He begins to fear they’ve snatched his beautiful city from him so they can live in it themselves.\\n\\nThe retelling:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe: The stakes are somewhat higher in this tour through the dreamworld. Vellitt Boe is a middle-aged professor at a women’s college in Ulthar, one of very few women who live in the dreamworld. She was a traveler in her youth, and is forced back on the road when one of her students elopes with a man from the waking world.\\nVellitt needs to bring the girl home before terrible things happen to the women’s college (which could lose its funding) or Ulthar (which could be razed by the gods). Vellitt, like Tom, is not mentioned in Unknown Kadath, but as a young woman she traveled with Carter and had a relationship with him.\\nIt’s refreshing to read a protagonist who is not only a woman, but who is an older woman. It’s also refreshing to read about the perils of the road from a woman’s perspective. It’s mentioned in the book that when she was a young traveler, Vellitt was raped, but it didn’t stop her from traveling. In our culture, we’re conditioned to think of rape as something that “breaks” the victim somehow. Vellitt isn’t broken. She acknowledges this happened to her, and moves on.\\n\\nThe Litany of Earth, a reimagining of The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\n\\nThe original:\\n\\nThe Shadow Over Innsmouth: The U.S. Government has begun a secret investigation of Innsmouth, Mass., a ruined fishing village. Why? Because Robert Olmstead, a young scholar, stumbled over the isolated village in his tour of New England.\\nOlmstead is first intrigued by the village’s history — they have some beautiful treasures there —but becomes more and more alarmed the longer he stays there. The villagers all look fish-like, and are secretive. After a conversation with the\\xa0 town drunk, he learns that the most of the villagers are half-humans (oh the horror!); they begin life as normal people, but turn into amphibious creatures called Deep Ones as they age. They practice human sacrifice and magic, and worship ancient gods in awful temples. Increasingly horrified, Olmstead fears for his life.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe retelling:\\n\\nThe Litany of Earth: It’s just after WWII. Aphra Marsh is 30 years old and — like the Japanese-American she rooms with in San Francisco — she has been recently released from the prison camp she spent most of her life in.\\nAphra is a native of Innsmouth, removed from that town when the U.S. Government destroyed it. She’s lost her home, her family, her culture, and her religion. She’s working in a bookstore when she’s approached by a federal agent who wants her help in tracking down other worshippers of Cthulu. He says they are dangerous. She doesn’t know what to believe.\\nIt’s easy to see the monsters in Lovecraft’s work as abominations, as he so often paints them. Emrys treats the amphibious people of Innsmouth with compassion; in her work they are just another people demonized and imprisoned by a paranoid and ignorant public.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n+\\nVIEW COMMENTS\\n\\n', \"Hear The Original Interview\\n\\nBruce Eric Kaplan's illustrated memoir I Was A Child describes his life in New Jersey in the '60s and '70s.

I loved the book and, like many, I was hooked on reading each and every one of Oprah's book club selections. It's been a quite a few years, but I recently decided to read another novel by Ms. Mitchard. Her latest is titled\\xa0\\n\\n, and it definitely has a unique premise.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO IF BY SEA tells the story of Frank Mercy, a former American police officer now living in Brisbane, Australia. Frank is happily married and excited about his wife's pregnancy when they are celebrating the Christmas holiday with his wife's family. And then the unspeakable happens! A tsunami hits Brisbane and kills Frank's entire family. Devastated by grief, he joins up with a volunteer rescue unit to help save others' lives.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrank encounters a three year old boy and his older brother in the water. He only has a few minutes to save them, and the older boy tells him to take the three year old because he's important. Frank immediately feels an affinity to this boy, who he decides to call Ian; and he ends up keeping the boy rather than turning him over to the authorities. He quickly makes an escape from Australia with Ian to his family farm in Wisconsin.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the way over to the states in the airplane, Frank realizes that Ian is, indeed, special. As strange as it sounds, Ian has a calming effect on animals and humans. He seems to be able to get into their minds and almost stop them from doing things that are dangerous.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Frank arrives back in Wisconsin, he tries to start over his life with his family and Ian (and even a new love interest); however, he is always looking over his shoulder, worried that someone is coming for Ian. Things take a nasty turn when Frank realizes that there are some very nasty people who are looking for Ian, and Frank is forced to make some difficult decisions to protect his child.\\n\\n\\n\\nI enjoyed TWO IF BY SEA, but I have to say that the first half of the book held my interest more than the second. In fact, the first few chapters were incredibly powerful. I was captured by the descriptions of Brisbane and the tsunami, and I thought Ms. Mitchard did a remarkable job of bringing that entire tragedy to life. I also loved how she introduced Ian, and I was most definitely intrigued by his telepathic gift.\\n\\n\\n\\nI found Frank to be a very well developed character, and I truly appreciated how he was a man who had experienced so many tragedies yet kept trying to start over. Granted, I should have been upset with him for basically kidnapping Ian and leaving the country; however, I was most definitely rooting for them. Ian and Frank had a special bond and I enjoyed seeing how their relationship evoked a certain feeling of hope to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can't really pinpoint when the book took a turn for me, but I think the suspense aspect of the story (when people from Ian's past showed up) just didn't interest me like the character development and relationship aspects of the story. I think because the first half of the book really captured my attention, I was expecting the entire book to keep the same pace. Looking back on it now, I don't really think that was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO IF BY SEA would make an interesting book club selection. There are some wonderful characters, and there are definitely some interesting moral dilemmas to discuss for your typical book clubs. However, fans of science fiction, the supernatural and suspense stories might be also be intrigued by this story. There is a\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0available with fourteen questions along with some ideas to enhance your meeting. Some of the themes you might want to explore include family, loss, grief, second chances, love, chance, morals, sacrifices, and parenthood.\\n\\n\\n\\nI enjoyed TWO IF BY SEA but I'm not sure I can go so far as to say I loved it... although I really wanted to love it!

This tension has existed as long as we’ve had human society of any complexity.\\n\\nDo hunters share their catch with the rest of the tribe or eat it themselves? Do mothers feed themselves or their children first? Do officials take bribes that will put their kids through college or accept the risk of rejecting corruption, with all its dangers? Do scientists share their data with colleagues or hide it away so only they benefit from the value?\\n\\nScience is one of the noblest of human activities and scientific activities undoubtedly have immense positive impacts on society – but can also be put to misuse in the wrong hands.\\n\\nThe beauty of science is that it is a knowledge beyond human invention. It is the pursuit of a higher reality, ‘truth’. Science is a process by which we gain human understanding of the physical laws that run the Universe. Science, is by definition objective, repeatable and self-correcting. Old ideas cave under the pressure of new evidence.\\n\\nYet, even science is not immune to breaches of conduct – because its practitioners aren’t.\\n\\nThe highest profile examples involve faked data and claims of ‘sell out scientists’ who are the shills of commercial ventures that harm society – for example, smoking.\\n\\nWhile such cases are hopefully the exceptions, underneath these headlines lie smaller self-serving actions – some of which would not be amiss on a soap opera.\\n\\nDaily academic life is rife with examples of offences against the ‘higher purpose’ of science to accrue human knowledge without bias.\\n\\nObstacles can include the rejection of new evidence, battles of egos, silo-ing of data, or sitting too long on a theory that is patently wrong, just because it is yours, as in the epic battle for acceptance of the theory of continental drift and plate tectonics.\\n\\nWhen C should best stand for collaboration, it often stands for competition. Antagonists have it in their powers to secretly squelch grants, subvert peer-review of paper and invite only insiders to conferences, all to stay ahead of the game.

The individual gets proper credit, esteem and personal satisfaction for advancing human knowledge. Science is advanced without hindrance. That is a win-win and there is nothing wrong with rewarding self. When it doesn’t harm society, that is.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that scientists swear the equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath, or a “universal code of ethics for scientists”, just as doctors have for millennia and promise never to harm and only to act in favour of public good.\\n\\nWhile few scientists in academia ever breach dangerous ethical boundaries, more might be vulnerable to institutionalized pressures to favour self in intensely competitive research environments.\\n\\nCurrently, features of academic life are stacked in ways that encourage scientists to put self first.\\n\\nShowing ones worth often puts a scientist in direct conflict with duty to society. Scientists keep their jobs, and advance, based on esteem factors that are based on self-promotion. Key merit promotion factors include things like the number of papers you write, where they are published and whether you are the lead author. All promote the work of self. This is understandable but can put scientists, as people like everyone else, in conflicted roles.\\n\\nMany scientists would love to change this landscape.\\n\\nWe should reward actions in science that help progress human knowledge and science – even over self.\\n\\nTo all scientists out there – how to do you answer the question?\\n\\nTo everyone – how do we best make an environment that fosters scientific activities that best benefit society?\\n\\nFeatured image credit: Bacteria, by\\xa0geralt.

Over the next four decades the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will nearly triple to more than 2 billion in 2050 (UN, 2013). With the aging of the population, the burden and cost of chronic disease will escalate worldwide. In order to ensure healthy and successful aging and reduce the cost of care for this huge increase, building resilience and wellbeing among the aging becomes a top priority for individuals, families, and society at large. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is well positioned to offer interventions leading to prevention of major mental and physical diseases of aging and improve the quality of life for aging individuals and their families.\\n\\nCIM therapies are defined by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered a part of conventional medicine” (NCCIH-NIH, 2015). The most recent comprehensive assessment of CIM use in the United States found that roughly 40% of US adults had used at least one CIM therapy within the past year (2007), spending billions of dollars out-of-pocket on these therapies. The use of CIM for treatment of mood and anxiety disorders includes acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga. The most commonly used CIM health techniques in general population include prayer for health and the use of multivitamin supplementation. Given widespread use of integrative or mind-body medicine among our patients, there is an urgent need for greater awareness of the applications and outcomes of the commonly used mind-body interventions.\\n\\nMind-body medicine encompasses a number of techniques collectively known as mindful exercise (e.g. yoga, Qigong and Tai Chi), or meditation. Mindful physical exercise has become an increasingly utilized approach for improving psychological well-being and is defined as “physical exercise executed with a profound inwardly directed contemplative focus.” In general, mindful physical exercise contains the following key elements: (1) a non-competitive, non-judgmental meditative component, (2) mental focus on muscular movement and movement awareness combined with a low to moderate level of muscular activity, (3) centered breathing, (4) a focus on anatomic alignment (i.e., spine, trunk, and pelvis) and proper physical form, (5) energy-centric awareness of individual flow of intrinsic body energy, otherwise known as life force, prana, Chi, or Kundalini. The mindful exercise has been shown to provide an immediate source of relaxation and mental quiescence. Scientific evidence has shown that medical conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, depression, and anxiety disorders respond favorably to the mindful exercises.\\n\\nThere is a growing database of the physiological effects of mindful exercise and meditation. Tai Chi and Qi Gong have been shown to promote relaxation and decrease sympathetic output, and to benefit anxiety, depression, blood pressure, and recovery from immune-mediated diseases. Both\\xa0have been shown to improve immune function and vaccine-response. These practices have also been shown to increase blood levels of endorphins and baroreflex sensitivity, and to reduce levels of inflammatory markers (CRP), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol, implicating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as a mediator of stress and anxiety reduction.\\n\\nStudies of meditation also report decreased sympathetic nervous activity and increased parasympathetic activity associated with decreased heart rate and blood pressure, decreased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen metabolism. In our recently published study of Kundalini yoga compared to memory training in older adults with subjective memory complaints, we found that the yoga group demonstrated a significant improvement in depression and visuospatial memory compared to the memory training group. Both interventions improved verbal memory performance. Improved verbal memory performance was associated with increased connectivity between the language processing brain network. These findings point at the potential of using yoga to offset and delay cognitive decline, improve mood and coping with stress, and enhance brain plasticity.\\n\\nGiven the noninvasive nature of mindful exercise and meditation, recommending these exercises to all those interested in stress reduction and to patients with mental disorders generally seems an appropriate option for consumers and clinicians, particularly for conditions that have been studied in controlled studies. Some of these preventive techniques will include stress reduction that will enhance resilience to stress, and can improve cognition. Many of these techniques can be learned outside of the medical system and include exercise, lifestyle changes, mindfulness and mindful exercise, and the use of any joyful activities that can enhance the quality of life of older adults and their families. Ethical considerations should be taken into account when practicing or recommending spiritual interventions by healthcare professionals to respect patients’ beliefs in choosing mind-body interventions.\\n\\nFeatured image credit: Group of people practicing yoga, by\\xa0Eli Christman.

Tonight I’m planting myself at Tacos Apson, named after the 1960s Mexican rock \\'n\\'\\xa0roll outfit of the same name. The spot is pinnacle Southside Mexcellence\\xa0— equal parts Mexican and excellent. After I place my order, I take a seat outside and enjoy the evening stars over Southside Tucson. Across from the restaurant, I see the blue gates of Pueblo Magnet High School, my alma mater. I eat my tacos and look closely at the school. Within its walls, I found poetry.\\n\\nGrowing up in an immigrant, Spanish-speaking household, we didn’t have much literature on our bookshelves: We had books on Mexican history, the Holy Bible\\xa0and an English dictionary. My father would use the dictionary to check the gringos at work who he said used bigger words to sound smarter around him. So between Bible verses, arbitrary facts about Mexico’s presidents\\xa0and words too big for my small Chicano lips, I was not at all interested in picking up a reading habit.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I entered my sophomore year of high school, my world literature teacher, Ms. Sarah Wilson, assigned us Leslie Marmon Silko’s \"Ceremony.\" In this book, I saw reflections of myself, of my family and friends, of Brown faces that were already all too familiar to me. Ceremony led me to Ralph Ellison’s \"Invisible Man,\" which led me to Gloria Anzaldúa’s \"Borderlands.\" These books formed my identity as a fronterizo, a child of the hyphen between Mexican and American. For the first time I was learning that my histories, and that of my ancestors’, were part of U.S. history.\\n\\nI became an active participant in the Tucson Youth Poetry Slam, or TYPS, a competitive poetry reading series for high schoolers from across the region. I began writing and performing poems about mi raza, my family, my community and myself. Inspired by Anzaldúa and León de la Rosa, I write my poetry in Spanglish to capture the tongue-dance of my upbringing.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a newfound appreciation for literature and a constant evolution of ideas about identity and history, my poetry became an outlet for all the emotions I never had words for. Thanks to the TYPS and its mother organization Spoken Futures, I read my poems across Arizona and have read in spaces where poetry had previously been unthought\\xa0of. In 2012, this included a school board candidate forum.\\n\\nThe Tucson Unified School District had stopped sending school buses to pick up students attending Pueblo without warning the community. Students forced to walk or take public transportation were showing up late to class and being penalized. \\xa0\\n\\nI was a part of Pueblo High’s Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlán, or MEChA, chapter, and we organized a forum about the inequity of transportation for Southside schools in Tucson. We invited school board members and candidates running for school board seats. To no surprise, the incumbent members declined our invitation, but all of the candidates running were in attendance. Before we started the forum, I performed a bilingual poem about the history of segregation and inequality in Tucson’s education system. Three months later, two of the candidates were elected as board members — and yellow buses returned to Pueblo.\\n\\nIn 2014, a year after I graduated, I published my first collection of poetry, \"Tortoise Boy Says,\" with Spoken Futures Press. It’s a culmination of my experiences as a young Chicano navigating the spectrums of identity and language in Arizona. I believe in the importance of empowering youth to find their voices and stories, this act is survival and resistance — it certainly was for me.\\n\\nEspecially now, in a moment in time where politicians and public figures like Donald Trump and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio are speaking to the deeply rooted racist and sexist sentiments of the U.S.’ white power structure. Platforms for marginalized voices are more important than ever to add depth to what it means to be an American.\\n\\nThere is urgency in the poems written by black, brown, native, Asian, undocumented, queer and trans writers that cannot be understood without first recognizing why we are standing up, writing and performing: We are — and have been — done with being passive recipients of cultural and physical violence simply because of our bodies and experiences. Coming of age in Arizona, where racist legislation has targeted the Mexican and Chicana/o community, the talk of deportations and 50-foot border walls is nothing new. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nThinking about my experience as a young poet of color, I understand how important my occupancy in literary and cultural spaces is, but I recognize that I am a cis-gendered, able-bodied, heterosexual Chicano. If I in turn failed to recognize who’s not in the room, I repeat the cycle of erasure. Hence this continual work to amplify voices that have gone unheard — just as mine was in my early teens. In solidarity with Black Lives Matter and Ni Una Mas, movements that demand the rehumanization of people stripped of their essence, I acknowledge the miraculous nature of being brown and proud and loud, of being Mexcellent, of being alive and thriving with poems rolling off my tongue like prayers.\\n\\nEnrique García Naranjo is a poet, performer and pocho from Tucson. He is a Tucson Youth Poetry Slam alumnus and a Spoken Futures INC staff member. His work has been published by and included in the Acentos Review, Brown, Proud y Loud Zine, Sunday Kinfolk and more.

Knopf. $35.\\n\\nThe story of the Romanov dynasty began in 1613 with Michael Romanov, chosen as Russia’s czar in the Time of Troubles, and ended in 1918 with Alexei Romanov, shot alongside his parents and sisters in the basement of a house in the Urals. During the three turbulent centuries that separated these two “fragile, innocent and ailing” boys, the dynasty produced 20 monarchs and several regents, including two rulers of genius — Peter and Catherine, the “Greats.” The czars wielded absolute power and led lives that were truly extraordinary, larger than other lives, consecrated by the mystical mission, the sacred compact between the ruler and Russia — the compact whose roots went deep into the medieval land of peasants and rituals, of myth and religion, of Byzantine icons and golden eagles, yet which survived, virtually unchanged, into the 20th century, until swept away by the \\xadrevolution.\\n\\nIn his mammoth 744-page opus, “The Romanovs,” Simon Sebag Montefiore, the eminent biographer of Joseph Stalin and Grigory Potemkin, covers the entire dynasty, from its rise to its apogee to its fall — an enterprise that has been accomplished only twice before, for reasons that become apparent just pages into the volume: It takes true historical daring to tackle such an immense subject.\\n\\nThe Romanovs inhabited a world of turmoil and excess, “a world where obscure strangers suddenly claim to be dead monarchs reborn, brides are poisoned, fathers torture their sons to death, sons kill fathers, wives murder husbands, .\\u2008.\\u2008. barbers and peasants ascend to supremacy,” and more and more. Endless visions of horror, splendor and absurdity — chopped-off heads soaked in vodka and courtiers traveling with their own portable gardens, children roasted and eaten in pogroms and wedding palaces carved out of ice, courtiers made to dress as chickens and sit clucking for hours and carriages pulled by bears — crowd one another so closely that the sheer concentration of history can become overwhelming. So dense is the material, in fact, that a single page bears the accounts of Czar Alexei’s courtship and marriage, a conspiracy involving accusations of sorcery, the birth of Peter the Great, the Cossack uprising of Stenka Razin complete with Razin’s gruesome execution, and a governmental reshuffle thrown into a footnote; and such pages are far from rare. (The footnotes, incidentally, contain some of the liveliest details, so readers are well advised not to skip them.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe backbone of the narrative, the theme that underlies the wealth of information, is the nature of autocracy, with its daily power struggles, succession troubles, assassination attempts, plots and rebellions. Montefiore describes his work as “a study of character and the distorting effect of absolute power on personality,” “a family story of love, marriage, adultery and children” made “extraordinary because power both sweetens and contaminates the traditional familial chemistry.” Other themes run through the book as well — the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities and the role of chance in history among them — but the author’s investigation into the nature of power, “that mysterious, invisible alchemy of personality, fear and authority,” remains his foremost concern. His insights tend to be pithy and sharp. “The vanishing of royal children at the hands of power-hungry relatives has a fitting way of destroying the very power they seek,” he says of the murky death of Ivan the Terrible’s youngest son, Dmitri. “As an autocrat becomes older, the struggle for influence intensifies, which in turn makes the sovereign more suspicious and therefore more dangerous,” he comments on the reign of Anna, while the assassination of Paul elicits an aside: “A fortress is only as safe as the men who guard it.”\\n\\nComing from the notable historian of Stalin, such aphorisms carry much weight. One may wish for more of them, as well as more overall context, more grounding of the events in the general cultural and economic climate, which is touched upon infrequently and briefly. But, perhaps inevitably in a study so concentrated, Montefiore’s approach favors facts over analysis and atmosphere. The facts themselves, many of them results of original research, are fascinating enough to speak for themselves, although there are occasional dry patches. Wars tend to become chronological lists of commanders replaced, troops moved, fortresses taken and lost, as the same players — \\xadSweden, Poland, the Ottomans, later Prussia, France, Britain — jostle for prominence on the great chessboard of Europe and later the world. Discussions of interior policy at times resemble a relentless parade of back-stabbing courtiers rewarded, dismissed, executed, pardoned, with complex plots and alliances made doubly obscure by complicated family connections, until one can sympathize with the loutish Alexander III, who was prone to shouting, “As for the ministers, the Devil take them.” Montefiore’s novelistic gift of drawing vivid characters with a few choice words never fails him — a greedy favorite is likened to the “shark that can clean its gills only by eating more,” while an official is described as “snoozing astride foreign policy like a somnolent, sickly sloth”; but, given the encyclopedic nature of the work, minor personalities come and go abruptly, and their individual time on the stage is simply too brief to make them \\xaddistinguishable.\\n\\nThe main portraits, on the other hand, are invariably memorable. Here is the red-bearded giant Alexei habitually tossing trussed-up boyars into a freezing river as punishment for their oversleeping his dawn church services; or Peter the Great having a beautiful ex-lover beheaded, then lifting her bloodied head, kissing it on the lips and lecturing the crowd on the windpipe and arteries; or the “Russian Venus” Elizaveta banning her ladies from wearing her favorite color, pink, then punishing a beauty who dared to wear a pink rose in her hair by having her tongue ripped out at a scaffold; or Catherine the Great, in the midst of a predawn revolution that would make her the ruler of Russia, commandeering a French hairdresser to fix her hair (“always important in a coup,” notes the author with a rare flash of humor). The rulers’ characters are further enriched by generous quotations from primary sources, including their own letters and diaries. (Peter is forceful and blunt: “Time is death.” Catherine is cautious and manipulative: “One must do things in such a way that people think they themselves want it to be done this way.”)\\n\\nWhen the story moves into the 19th century, the age of the three Alexanders and the two Nicholases, the narrative slows down somewhat, taken over by military maneuvers and royal love affairs; yet there is always plenty of interest to keep one’s attention, until, at the turn of the 20th century, the drama intensifies once again as the story reaches the dark sweep of its spellbinding last chapters.\\n\\nGiven the profusion of scandalous events and characters like Nicholas\\u202fII and Rasputin who have passed from history into myth, it can be a challenge to keep the tone objective, and here Montefiore succeeds with seeming ease, offering a scholar’s well-balanced perspective on some of the more notorious episodes. He dispels the myth of Catherine the Great as the “nymphomaniac of legend,” downplays the possibility that Alexander I faked his own death and casually drops a number of bombshells that remain, appropriately, unexploded; for instance, Catherine, wife of Peter III, claimed that their heir, the future Paul I, born in 1754, was in actuality her lover’s son, prompting a single \\xadmatter-of-fact comment: “which would make the entire dynasty down to 1917 Saltykov, not Romanov.” The account remains even-keeled throughout, and the last years of the dynasty especially are treated with a restraint and objectivity for which one is grateful.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nDC Entertainment Reveals New Logo\\n\\nBy Maryann Yin\\xa0on May. 18, 2016 - 2:30 PMComment\\n\\nDC Entertainment has unveiled its new logo.\\n\\nDC Universe: Rebirth Special #1 will be the first comic\\xa0published by the company to feature the new logo.\\xa0Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns\\xa0wrote the story for this book.

Philosophers, historians, and the general public, have always related it to a philosophical doctrine or a technological effect. However, there is a type of realism — very widespread in science — that has gone unnoticed among scholars: the realist attitude of social and cultural origins. Behind this attitude lie commercial and engineering interests. Identifying this attitude is vital, because many scientists’ ideas were influenced by these kinds of interests.\\n\\nUntil now, the most known type of realism in science has been the operational one. The Stanford School philosophers, Ian Hacking and Nancy Cartwright, held that scientists are justified in believing in the existence of theoretical entities only when they’re able to use them to produce effects. They called this fact “operational realism.” Thus, the existence of an entity, such as an electron, can be established only through manipulation and experiment. What convinces scientists that they’re seeing electrons is no empirical adequacy of theory, but the fact that they can manipulate in a direct and tangible way to achieve certain results. In fact, Hacking’s most famous motto says: “if you can spray them, then they’re real” — that is, an entity is real if we can manipulate it; so, manipulability is evidence of existence.\\n\\nHowever, the point made here is trickier. And interestingly, it’s closely linked to another fundamental question: how commercial interests shape scientific conceptions.\\n\\nFew would deny the great influence of technology and industry on scientific progress, a topic that has provided valuable insight into how science depends on technical advances, how it depends on industry, and how it depends on the society in which it’s done. However, how, exactly, do these factors shape science? Are industry and commerce just means that provide know-how and tools to science? Or do they affect the concepts and values themselves of science? If so, how and to what extent?\\n\\nIf there are sciences that regard their concepts and methods as pure knowledge, physics and the exact sciences are among them. They’re often taken as the archetype of sciences: their knowledge has never — or at most, slightly — been affected by “external” factors. Physical advances, it is said, are well-founded, built on solid mathematical theories, and resistant to external influences. They’re “pure” knowledge, free of any commercial contamination, unaffected by factors such as industrial demands, commercial achievements, or social pressure. This, at least, is what a great part of the scientific literature contends.\\n\\nHowever, there are cases of industries that challenge the “purity” of science. I’ll mention two twin industries: both used artificially created waves as a means for exploration; both included academic scientists and industrial scientists; and both were related to geophysics. Their stories are similar in some ways. The first has to do with the radio industry and with how this affected the study of the Earth’s upper atmosphere (also known as ionosphere). During the interwar years, some leading radio physicists like Edward V. Appleton in Britain and Merle A. Tuve in the US, claimed the discovery of the structure of the ionosphere — that is, the Heaviside (E) layer, the lower (D) and upper (F) layers, and the F1 and F2 sub-layers.\\n\\nThe second has to do with the oil industry and with how this affected the Earth’s crust (or crustal seismology). During WWII and the post-war period, most of American physicists abandoned simple and idealised crustal models and put forward realist arguments regarding crustal layers. Although their research areas were different, the two groups of physicists had one thing in common: they both adopted a realist attitude towards theoretical entities, such as layers and discontinuities.\\n\\nBut the physicists’ realism was about concepts rather than theories. Indeed, it stemmed not from a given philosophical doctrine (i.e. scientific realism), but from a pragmatic attitude. From the 1920s to 1950s, radio physicists and crustal geophysicists laid aside normative questions such as: what entities should we know?; what do we really know? Instead, they asked factual questions, like: what kinds of entities are in the Earth’s crust and in the ionosphere? What constitutes direct evidence for the existence of these entities, and what’s true of them?\\n\\nBut here the key question is: is operational realism proper enough to explain the realist attitude of radio scientists and crustal geophysicists? Everything appears to indicate that it isn’t. Although wave manipulation might well have made the ionosphere seem more real, the emergence of realist attitudes occurred before wave experiments in the mid-1920s (these experiments were carried out by using the sounding-echo technique). Before that, the Marconi Company’s radio engineers firmly believed in the existence of a reflecting layer in the ionosphere. Similarly, the emergence of realist attitudes towards crustal layers occurred before wave experiments in the early 1950s (these were carried out through explosion seismology). If wave manipulation and intervention weren’t the primary cause, what led them to adopt realist attitudes? The answer is a “new” kind of realism: a realism of social and cultural origins. Namely, an entity realism that responds to very specific interests: to commercial and engineering questions.\\n\\nFor example, in the case of ionospheric exploration, radio engineers devised techniques assuming the existence of a reflecting layer in the upper atmosphere. (Some years later, physicists emulated them in their sounding-echo experiments). For engineers and industrial scientists, there was a direct relationship between commercial achievement and the existence of the layers imagined in their planning.\\n\\nIn other words, commercial success depended on the prediction of objectives. The prediction of questions, such as the maximum usable frequency and the location of oil bearings, was key for commercial success; and this was linked to the use of useful pictures of the Earth’s inscrutable regions. Therefore, much of their realist attitude had to do with the need to provide a useful picture of the ionosphere and the Earth’s crust, with the need to predict objectives, with the need to reach commercial achievements.\\n\\nFeatured image credit: Cascade by Antonis Lamnatos.

I prefer to believe that the prompt was in the For when Wittgenstein returned to philosophy, the idea that drove him beyond all others was that the nature of language had been misunderstood by philosophers … Words did not, he had come to believe, primarily provide a picture of life (the word “snake” representing, or sounding like, an actual snake); they were better conceived of as a part of the activity of life. As such, they were more like tools.”\\n\\nJacob Harris was scoping out some nineteenth-century newspaper ads (don’t judge; this is how some of us get our kicks) when he stumbled upon an ad for the Brooklyn Furniture Co. composed entirely of typography—a direct predecessor of the ASCII art that would come more than a century later. “The face resembles modern ASCII art, but it was published at a time—March 20, 1881—that seemed impossibly early,” he writes: “In many newspapers, these early examples of text art vanished not long after they arrived … apart from the two advertisements I had found, the style apparently never caught on in the Times. But why not? To answer that, I looked more at the Eagle where I found the earliest ads—and where they survived for several decades longer than everywhere else. They are there in 1881, when one bold advertiser filled an entire page with ASCII text. There are there in 1888, when the Eagle advertised its election night almanac in the familiar large letters. They are there all the way up to July 3, 1892, a day the same Brooklyn Furniture Company again ran a half-page ad with their address in large ASCII letters. And, then, on July 5th, they were completely gone, replaced by modern layouts and fancy typography. Those upgrades likely explain, at least in part, what happened. ASCII art flourishes most when technology is limited; you don’t need Print Shop anymore when you can do digital layout on your computer and have an inkjet printer.”\\n\\n“The gift and curse of American hyperbole, truthful and otherwise, has lately been distilled in a single omnipresent word.

Abrams Admits: \\'It\\'s Not Cloverfield 2\\' But It Does Have a Monster\\n\\nby Alex Billington February 26, 2016Source: Fandango\\n\\nFinally, the truth comes out. No, 10 Cloverfield Lane is not a Cloverfield sequel. In fact, it has nothing to do with Cloverfield (the original 2008 monster movie), producer J.J. Abrams finally admits: \"This movie is very purposefully not called Cloverfield 2, because it\\'s not Cloverfield 2.\" However, what he\\'s getting at here is the \"bigger picture\" concept behind why Cloverfield is in the title and what they\\'re going for: \"there is a bigger idea at play for us with these movies and this connection.\" Essentially, movies made by Bad Robot that end up with \"Cloverfield\" in the title or synopsis are part of a series of \"monster movies\" that deal with a big sci-fi threat - not specifically the same monster. Abrams finally cleared the air about what to expect.\\n\\nEver since the first trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane premiered in theaters, fans have been going crazy with excitement at the possibility that they made a Cloverfield sequel in secret and it\\'s out in two months and no one knew. But of course, that was a bit too perfect to be true. The reality is that the project was produced under the name Valencia and they did, at some point in production, change the title with the idea that it would connect into a bigger series of thrilling sci-fi movies that deal with a \"monster\" of some kind. Abrams says this movie \"is definitely about different kinds of monsters,\" but obviously wouldn\\'t say more than that.\\n\\nErik Davis of Fandango talked with J.J. Abrams recently and got a few key quotes from him (seen below) regarding what exactly 10 Cloverfield Lane is. Obviously not much is fully revealed but it is worth reading.\\n\\n\"This movie is very purposefully not called Cloverfield 2, because it\\'s not Cloverfield 2,\" Abrams says, adding that \"the association is clear and there are multiple connections – and there is a bigger idea at play for us with these movies and this connection.\"\\n\\nSo does 10 Cloverfield Lane take place during the first Cloverfield?\\n\\n\"No it doesn\\'t, but there\\'s a larger thing at play with these connections,\" Abrams continues. \"And the fun of it is that some of these connections – and there\\'s a lot of them – are not the kind of connections you might think. So if you\\'re approaching it as a literal sequel, you\\'ll be surprised to see what this movie is. But while it\\'s not what you might expect from a movie that has the name \\'Cloverfield\\' in it, I think you\\'ll find that you\\'ll understand the connection when you see the whole thing.\"\\n\\nSo that means - go see it and you\\'ll know what he means and everything will be revealed, of course. Arrives in theaters starting on March 11th next month. Abrams adds a bit more about how it all came together:\\n\\n\"The story of this movie – and it came to us originally as a spec that was very different in a lot of ways and an unrelated thing altogether – is definitely about different kinds of monsters,\" he says. \"And while the Cloverfield monster isn\\'t in this movie, there\\'s a new monster and there\\'s something else that happens… but I don\\'t want to ruin the ending.\"\\n\\nYes - so once again, go see the movie and everything will be revealed, but be on the lookout for hidden connections. I\\'m glad Abrams is coming out with this - see the full interview on Fandango. In a separate interview with EW, Abrams adds: \"This is just this movie, and it\\'s only two films that we\\'re talking about right now. There is something else that we\\'d like to do, and hopefully we\\'ll get a shot.\" SlashFilm speculates this could be another small script called God Particle. And for those wondering, \"the decision to connect it to Cloverfield happened a long time ago, but it was a very conscious decision not to announce it as such,\" Abrams claims. I\\'m very curious to find out. Will all our questions be answered in March? Only J.J. knows.\\n\\nFor those still wondering about the possibility of a Cloverfield sequel, it\\'s not entirely off the table. Abrams: \"there were a lot of ideas [for a follow-up] – at one point there was this really big idea for doing three different things at once. A lot of things were thrown around. But we now live in that post-Godzilla, post-Pacific Rim era where those movies have been made, so what would we do?\" But here is still some hope: \"I was actually talking to Drew [Goddard] last week about what would happen if we continued that specific story [as told in the first Cloverfield], and there are some fun ideas, but still not \\'the thing.\\' There\\'s a reason why the movie we\\'re talking about right now isn\\'t Cloverfield 2, but something else entirely.\" I guess he means to say - they still haven\\'t figured out an innovative idea for Cloverfield 2, but this movie is something interesting on its own, and is worth checking out anyway. Sounds good - only a few weeks to go.\\n\\nFor those interested in more of this world - the viral marketing ARG underway for 10 Cloverfield Lane has exciting things going on. SlashFilm has been covering it closely, reporting on games and other activities all based around a website at FunandPrettyThings.com. The character John Goodman plays, Howard Stambler, is running the site to keep in touch with his daughter - he posts updates here. There are hidden/subliminal images in the latest footage, which is very cool, connecting everything together which lead one Reddit user to dig up a box buried at some coordinates, containing a few things including a USB drive with mysterious files on it.

And Rock stoked the intrigue, refusing to do pre-Oscar publicity while he honed his material. He didn\\'t want to give anything away and for good reason -- this wouldn\\'t just be a fun hosting job; it felt vital, important, and now. And boy did he pull it off.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow, our favorite Chris Rock moments form this year\\'s \\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen one of Rock\\'s first remarks in his monologue was, \"If they nominated hosts, I wouldn\\'t even get this job,\" you knew that it was going to be pretty no-holds-barred. And, well, it was. His monologue focused primarily on the issue of race, which set a tone for the rest of the evening, in which Rock would return to this well again and again. He described the Academy as \"sorority racist,\" referred to \"\\n\\n\" as \"Black Rocky,\" and took a jab at Oscar-boycotting \\n\\n, when he said \"it\\'s also not fair Will Smith was paid $20 million for \\'\\n\\n.\\'\" It was wild, in-your-face and utterly hilarious.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a throwaway gag but, following his melodramatic rendition of \\n\\n (from \"\\n\\n\"), Rock made a jab at Sam Smith. Rock said that \"Father Figure\" was his favorite song, a reference to the hit 1988 single.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an amazing pre-taped bit \\n\\n hosted the \"Black History Month Minute.\" It seemed like she was talking about a famous African American actor (hello, Will Smith!) until it was revealed that she was instead describing the career of \\n\\n. Get it? Black? So good.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, this was another minor moment but one we loved deeply: when introducing Michael B. Jordan, Rock referred to him as a \"should-have-been nominee,\" referring to the sentiment of many, that Jordan should have been recognized for his exceptional, deeply felt work in \"Creed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt one point, Rock made mention that there were some real life characters in the audience, including the woman that inspired \\n\\n\\'s \"\\n\\n.\" But the best was when Rock pointed out \\n\\n, the violent, frequently imprisoned villain from \"\\n\\n.\" (The actor playing Suge Knight is strapped to a gurney like Hannibal Lecter.) Later in the ceremony, Knight is seen freed, seemingly because he gave his jailers Girl Scout Cookies. Which brings us to...\\n\\n\\n\\n...In a bit of off-the-cuff wackiness that was like a funny version of what \\n\\n tried to do back in the day, Rock introduced his daughter\\'s Girl Scout troop, who then sold boxes of Girl Scout Cookies to seated celebrities. It was charming and sweet and served as a cute anecdote to the otherwise acerbic humor coming from Rock all night. Later in the show, he revealed that the troop had raised more than $65,000 and as he signed off, he passed out cookies to the winning team behind \"\\n\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the laugh-out-loud funniest moments of the entire ceremony was a pre-taped segment when Rock visited a Compton movie theater to ask moviegoers about the Oscars. (Spoiler alert: they had never, ever heard of \"\\n\\n.\") This piece was symbolic of Rock\\'s overall approach to the ceremony: he hit the issue of racism in the Academy Awards with surgical precision while also making light of the situation. It is both jovial and cutting. And the bit also illuminated the fact that the Oscars largely nominate movies that no one ever actually sees.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother small moment we loved: when pint-sized stars \\n\\n (from \"\\n\\n\") and \\n\\n (\"\\n\\n\"), who were presenting Best Short Film, Rock ran out to put apple boxes on the stage so they could actually be heard by the microphone.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the insanely long night, Rock invited everyone to the BET Awards this summer. He also said \"Black Lives Matter\" and handed \\n\\n a Girl Scout cookie. It was truly an amazing end to an amazing night.

Carol producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen and their company Number 9 Films seem to have cracked a way to turn good taste into a viable business. They are\\xa0on the verge of having their biggest ever year. Buoyed by the critical success in 2015 of Todd Haynes’ period love story, not to mention Oscar winner Paolo Sorrentino’s Youth, Woolley and Karlsen now have a quartet of high-end projects in various stages of production.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs exclusively revealed by Deadline, the husband and wife team have brought Brooklyn actress Saoirse Ronan on-board On Chesil Beach, with acclaimed theatre director Dominic Cooke (The Hollow Crown) making his feature directorial debut with the adaptation of the bestselling Ian McEwan novel. Production is set to start in the fall.\\n\\nNumber 9 also has Keira Knightley biopic Colette, about the French novelist who wrote Gigi and Cheri, which sold out for Hanway Films at the recent EFM in Berlin. The project, is a co-production with Killer Films and Bold Films- who also finance.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s more, Woolley and Clarkson have two other prestige pics in post: Jane Goldman’s adaptation of Peter Ackroyd’s best-selling novel Dan Leno And The Limehouse Golem, which Juan Carlos Medina (Painless) has directed. The film, which will simply be called The Limehouse Golem, is set in 1880 London and is a gothic murder mystery described as being in the style of David Fincher’s Seven and James Watkins’ The Woman In Black. The late Alan Rickman, Olivia Cooke, Bill Nighy and Douglas Booth star in the film.\\n\\nAlso coming out later this year is Their Finest Hour and a Half, starring Gemma Arterton and Bill Nighy, in a screwball World War 2 caper set around the misadventures of a British movie crew trying to make a patriotic film to boost morale during the Blitz. An Education’s Lone Scherfig directs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe busy duo managed to find time to sit down with Deadline to discuss the challenges- and appeal- of staying resolutely independent in an unforgiving industry.\\n\\nDEADLINE: You guys are on a roll. How do you manage to keep everything afloat given how hard we keep hearing it is to get the kind of high-end fare you produce moving along?\\n\\nEK. We aim to make two films a year. We’re very hands on producers. We are still a very small company. There is only Stephen and I, Joanna Laurey and two assistants. So there’s five of us. To make two films a year is quite a big ask for a company of our size but we really try. We have a development slate of I’d say about six or seven projects. It has just happened that those projects have come through in the way they have. With our conversion rate being so high, we have found by the time we get to the end of next year it means we might have come to the end of our slate. And we’ve never had that experience before. You become a victim of your conversion rate success because as a small company you can’t really afford to have this massive development slate and not get anything into production. It means we’ve kept it to projects we feel very passionate about and feel fit our sensibilities and our passions.\\n\\nSW: It’s a miracle because our slate is very small and we don’t plan to have a huge slate. We are looking now for the first time in a while at expanding the slate a little bit but we’re not out there just searching. The reality is that our projects organically grow. We’ve done a lot of projects with the same directors, the same writers. We enjoy an extremely good relationship with talent and that’s what our strength is. Our strength has always been, from my first movies with Neil Jordan, from working closely on the scripts, working closely on conceptual ideas of what it is we are trying to achieve. We’re not dictatorial but at the same time we’re very hands on from the beginning, which means we generally are very close to the book, the ideas, the development, the development department, the partners, the process and we tend to take that through till the bitter end. That stretches all the way back to when we had Palace Pictures and when we were making films for distribution. We kind of knew we were having to make films to get to an audience. So we do like to think that we try and make films for audiences. We don’t simply sign on for the ride if some auteur or some writer says ‘I want to do this’. We are quite investigative in terms of the quality of the material and what we would like. Which is not to say that if somebody walked in now with a great script that we wouldn’t go, “great we love this, too.”\\n\\nDEADLINE: How do you get access to material. That is always the biggest challenge, isn’t it?\\n\\nEK: We were approached by Indigo films, Paolo Sorrentino’s producers, to be the producers on Youth. We read the script and loved it and we knew that they were talking to a few producers. We read the script on a Wednesday, we flew to Rome on the Friday to have lunch with them because we felt so passionate about him and that particular project. And having Michael Caine attached – this is the fourth film that we’ve done with Micheal – which was a big draw for us. We clinched the deal there and then at lunch. Out of that has come a relationship with Indigo where different projects have been passing between the two of us. We have one that’s in development and other scripts that they keep sending us, ideas we’ve been sending them. Similarly with Killer Films. We have done two films together and now we are doing Colette which is something they brought to us because it’s European based. They asked us to help shape the whole thing and push it forward. To have a spirit of collaboration that works with another small – like ourselves – production company and producers has also been something we’ve enjoyed in our company. To develop a project right from the idea stage- as we did on\\xa0Made In Dagenham, which was a radio program, or theatre pieces like Little Voice. It’s a very, very long process that can last up to five years. It has been wonderful having relationships with another company who are also hands-on creative producers, who know how to build finance, how to build a project creatively and see it right through to the end. Those kind of projects can kind of pop in there while the other things are being developed from scratch.\\n\\nDEADLINE: Given your limited resources, how do you find yourselves able to compete against some of the bigger companies and even studios when they dip into the indie market. Do you ever want to play in a bigger sandbox?\\n\\nEK– I find where I am\\xa0very exciting. We can’t be in the game of acquiring the\\xa0bestselling books. We can’t compete against the Working Titles. We don’t have that kind of financial access. But there is a wealth of material out there. It’s just identifying that thing you want to make. There are bestsellers, but sometimes they only last for a moment and a lot of stuff very quickly falls away and is forgotten. I’m interesting in finding material on the margin or\\xa0it will be things that people tried and couldn’t get off the ground. There’s examples of that all over. Just look at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\xa0, which was somewhere, didn’t get off the ground and then Blueprint picked it up and it becomes what it becomes. We had that experience with Carol,\\xa0where in many ways we were building it from scratch. It was something I had been\\xa0desperate to do but the rights weren’t free for so long. \\xa0I do find it exciting because you’re working in a world where everyone is focusing on what the thing is of the moment and then you go, well, actually there is this story over\\xa0here and no one has seen it\\xa0or maybe no one believed in it. But we’re going to pick this up and run with it.\\n\\nSW: The zeitgeist doesn’t need to dictate. That bestseller today is not necessarily going to be popular during the 2 years it takes to make the film. So often – and I think this is why Hollywood often relies very much on remakes of old classics- \\xa0they recognise things sometimes are sustainable over a long period of time and never go away. It takes a while to develop and get a great script. It takes you a while to shoot it and to edit it and release it.\\xa0You can’t afford as filmmakers to make too many films that don’t make an impact. Which is not to say that we’re aiming to outgrow Avatar or become the next Star Wars.\\n\\n\\n\\nEK: Or Deadpool\\n\\nSW: Deadpool is an interesting one . I like Deadpool. What we can do is nurture ideas and originality and uniqueness and that’s something we try to do so that we aren’t falling into a groove\\xa0of making what everyone expects us to make. You look at The Revenant, which had about 150 times the budget of Carol,\\xa0or Mad Max, there is no chance in the world that we would produce necessarily either of those two films. \\xa0Mad Max is a franchise movie even if it’s winning lots of awards. We can’t be in the Mad Max business.\\xa0I’m not saying that in a limiting way.\\xa0\\xa0We’re in the David\\xa0business, not the Goliath business. And actually that David business is a huge business and I think we realise that.\\n\\nEK: When you get it right\\n\\nSW: – There is a huge audience there for unusual, unique, different types of movies. In Britain we have always been able to mine that incredibly well.\\n\\nEK: I feel that because of the way that Stephen and I work, I don’t think we will will be able to change. There is huge amounts of pride that come with making a film like Carol and working with a filmmaker like Todd Haynes. As a producer to think that you have made something that will enter the canon of great films and will be written about for generations to come. Because of the hands-on way we work even with the VOD/ DVD release we’ll be there\\xa0working on the cover art- I think for us to do more than two\\xa0films a year would be very challenging because we won’t be exercising the same control and that nurturing presence. We’ve always said that we want to move into TV, for example, but we felt an organic move into TV is really the best way to go instead of setting up a structure/infrastructure and then try to fill that infrastructure with materials. We’ve always been talent and material driven so it feels as though establishing that TV arm should really come organically from either a spin-off project that we’ve done or talent that we’ve worked really close with who’s coming to us with an idea.\\n\\nSW: As for\\xa0the sandbox, I have no problems making big-budget films. I made Interview with the Vampire\\xa0with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. We’ve worked on big budget films with Dreamworks, Columbia, Warner Bros. I don’t have a problem with that at all. iIthink it has to be the right kind of film, that’s all. It’s all well and good to do a studio deal but it has to be a studio deal that allows you to\\xa0bring to the project what can make it thrive. Not simply a deal where you’re making films that they want you to make.\\n\\n\\n\\nEK: One of the things we’re really proud of is building\\xa0some really seminal creative and financial relationships in this\\xa0industry. We’ve worked with Hanway\\xa0on\\xa0five films, for example. Some distributors, who share our passion for filmmaking and share the aesthetics and the sensibilities, and who have done well with us\\xa0are now coming to us and saying “Do you want some development money?” That’s really beneficial because it takes away our whole anxiety level. Developing a project is a long and sometimes tedious and flawed business. You’ve got to stick it out. You cannot\\xa0be frightened to make those changes to the script, for example. It’s very hard for us to develop something with the U.S.,\\xa0for example, because they’re 3000 or 5000 miles away and you don’t have that same kind of relationship that you can develop. We’ve\\xa0got some great relationships with\\xa0Studio Canal. We have another Phyllis Nagy script we’re working on with them now which will tie in well with Universal\\xa0Music Group. Those relationships are important to us. \\xa0You also have to try and get into a position where talent want to come to you. This year in particular has been a terrific one, because for such a tiny, tiny company, based in the UK, to have had the productions we’ve had with the co-producers and talent, it’s phenomenal. All we’re doing is putting our heads down and getting on with it because it’s a roller coaster ride.\\n\\nSW: We’d rather make one great movie where we’re sharing a few producers credit than 10 lousy movies where we’re getting all the credits and acclaim. We’re looking for great ideas and sometimes that’s not an easy life.\\n\\nEK: We wouldn’t be in this business if we were\\n\\nSW: We wouldn’t be making the kind of films we’re doing if we were looking for an easy life.\\n\\nDEADLINE: Is the focus on female driven stories intentional?\\n\\nSW: What we really found interesting about Colette was it fits into what we’ve always been attracted to, namely the telling of a story that people think they know but from an angle which is\\xa0unique and original. That’s what we loved about the script. It was from a very modern perspective. It shares sensibilities with\\xa0what Baz Luhrmann did with his totally modern version of Moulin Rouge,\\xa0even\\xa0this is not a musical. It\\xa0transports\\xa0you into the eyes of Colette as a modern woman, born out of time. You’re looking at a modern relationship but in the setting of what you’d consider to be archaic and old-fashioned. It’s\\xa0a story that shows you the past not only through today’s eyes but as though it is today. That’s why it is such a great script. t’s a similar thing we did with\\xa0Backbeat\\xa0all those years ago about The Beatles in Hamburg. It was a\\xa0story that people didn’t know about and it also made John Lennon a human being , not a god. It\\xa0told the story about when the Beatles were just kids, and people loved that. They love humanising the past, rather than glorifying it.\\n\\nDEADLINE: You’re reuniting with Saoise Ronan on On Chesil Beach after working together on Byzantium\\n\\nNominated for Best Actress, Brooklyn\\n\\n\\n\\nEK: We\\xa0were approached by Saoirse’s\\xa0agent, Chris Andrews, who must have heard we came on the project. We said yes that’s true and we set a meeting up with Dominic Cook, who is directing, and Saoirse. We’ve worked with her before in Byzantium and she was just terrific. Her performance in Brooklyn was just radiant and transcendent. Dominic met her and just fell in love.\\n\\nSW: She has an ethereal presence, which is extraordinary. She is in\\xa0the top 4 or 5 actresses in the world. You just have her walk into a scene and you immediately want to know who she is and what she’s about.\\n', '\\n\\n\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tBy \\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tKevin Jagernauth\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\t|\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tThe Playlist\\nThu Mar 03 09:00:29 EST 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n00000151-adec-d8a2-a353-fdec8f6b0000\\n\\nFor the sad few on the internet who are still appalled that women (gasp!) have been cast in the lead roles of upcoming \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, Sony Pictures honcho Tom Rothman has a very simple message. \"Everybody says I\\'m making the female Ghostbusters, but I say, \\'No, we\\'re making the funny Ghostbusters.\\' Yes, it happens to be four women. It\\'s original. You get pissing and moaning on the Internet — sexist comments – but, you know, fuck \\'em,\" he said in November. And you know what?

Director Paul Feig (\"Bridesmaids,\" \"Spy\") is behind the camera, and as far as stakes go, this is probably his biggest movie ever, with a franchise riding on his shoulders. Helping to bridge the gap will be cameos by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts (from the previous films) in a new roles, and the appearance of a classic character.\\n\\n\"I got to work with Slimer, dude. Like Slimer!!! I’m in a scene with Slimer! I’m a huge Ghostbusters fan and it was a dream come true,\" Michael K.

Watch below.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n', 'Donald Trump’s name is never uttered in Richard Nelson’s quietly incandescent Hunger, a play that feels as fresh as if\\xa0it was written this morning — which, in fact, it actually was. Hunger, which opened Friday evening at the Public Theater, also took place on Friday evening, 24 hours after the latest Republican candidates’ debate gifted us with\\xa0words and images we can’t, sadly, unhear or unsee from men who would be President.\\xa0“You watched that? How could you watch that?” Joyce Gabriel asks her gathered family, at once incredulous and numb from the political circus that will not end until it devours itself, or us. “It sort of feels to me like we’re all about to jump off some crazy high cliff,\\xa0doesn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHunger is the first of three plays in The Gabriels: Election Year In The Life Of One Family. We have returned to the Hudson Valley\\xa0hamlet of Rhinebeck, NY, the deceptively cozy setting of Nelson’s inspired quartet The Apple Family Plays.\\xa0\\xa0They\\xa0began on the eve of the 2010 midterm elections, took us through the election of Barack Obama and ended on the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination — without ever leaving the the kitchen and dining area of one house in that exurban outpost two hours\\xa0north of Manhattan by car. (The four plays, performed by an ensemble of some of the best actors in the country, were beautifully presented last year on public television.)\\n\\nNow Nelson returns — like Horton Foote to his fictional town of Harrison, TX and August Wilson to his real Pittsburgh, PA — to a different family. The Gabriels appear to be of more modest means than the Apples: The kitchen, with its mustard-yellow fridge and white enamel electric range, suggests an upgrade half a century in the past, and the wine that Mary Gabriel serves her family comes from the bargain bin at the local liquor store. Mary (the simmering Maryann Plunkett, a veteran of the Apple plays, whose facial features seem to verge on cracking but never do) is a retired doctor whose wheelchair-bound playwright and novelist husband Thomas died four months before the action of the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe cares for Thomas’ mother (the great Roberta Maxwell, in a near cameo at the end).\\xa0On this day, Mary’s visited by Thomas’ brother George (Jay O. Sanders, also from the Apple plays) a piano teacher and cabinet maker, and his wife Hannah (Lynne Hawley), who earns a living working for a local caterer. Thomas’ sister Joyce (Amy Warren), a costume designer, is up from Brooklyn. Karin (Meg Gibson), the first of Thomas’ two ex-wives, also has come for the memorial service (and shows no particular urgency about leaving). Mary begins the play by kneading dough alone and will end it by following this chain of unsettled souls into the offstage dining room for the meal they have been preparing for the last 100 minutes.\\n\\nEverything and nothing happens in those 100 minutes, as reminiscences of the departed Thomas are interwoven with observations about the creeping gentrification transforming the town as snotty weekenders multiply, bringing with them bad manners and the threat of entering local politics. The Roosevelt House museum has just been renovated, and the\\xa0Gabriels just\\xa0hate it. “What did they do to it?” Mary asks. “The museum? Everything,” Joyce answers “You feel they are pushing things on you now. Like you can’t think for yourself anymore. I’m sure it’s what the Bush libraries are like. In Texas.” “I’ll bet you the Bush libraries are even worse, Joyce,” Hannah says, by way of offering comfort. There is an inconclusive discussion about the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton’s truthiness factor and the quality of her laugh.\\n\\nBut that’s about as overtly political as Nelson (Hyde Park On Hudson; the plays Two Shakespearean Actors, Some Americans Abroad) gets — and what makes these plays so rich: Their politics aren’t ornamental but emerge from\\xa0people who find meaning in baking bread, building cabinets and playing Schumann on the piano. They have surprises; they’re immune to our prejudices. They live.\\n\\nNelson again directs his work with assurance and the cast is fine; the standouts are Plunkett and Sanders, married in real life and long-since exquisitely attuned to the smallest detail and nuance of these appealing characters. Hungry will be followed in September and November by the last two Gabriel family plays, which are certain to be more civilized and civilizing than the surreal events unfolding in the world around\\xa0them.\\n', '\\n            The high court won\\'t jumpstart a review of copyright or antitrust laws.\\n        \\n\\nOn Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court passed on the opportunity to review two cases that have garnered attention in the entertainment industry.\\n\\nIn one case,\\xa0Mark Towle, a California mechanic who made replica Batmobiles, aimed to have the high court take a look at an opinion from\\xa0the 9th\\xa0Circuit Court of Appeals that Batman\\'s vehicle of choice deserves copyright protection.\\xa0Towle, who sold his replicas for $90,000 apiece and was sued by Warner Bros. subsidiary DC Comics, argued that the\\xa0Batmobile is merely functional — a \"useful article,\" legal-speak for a utilitarian rather than artistic object.\\xa0\\n\\nIn her opinion in Sept. 2015, 9th Circuit judge Sandra Ikuta agreed with DC that the\\xa0Batmobile\\xa0is not just a \"useful article\" — excluded from copyright protection — but\\xa0that it\\'s also a \"character\" with \"physical as well as conceptual qualities,\" and \"sufficiently delineated\" to be recognizable whenever and wherever it appears.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, without comment, denied\\xa0Towle\\'s\\xa0cert petition seeking to introduce the arguments that Congress specifically excluded this subject matter from copyright protection and that\\xa0the Batmobile hardly displays any personality traits or any consistent and widely-identifiable physical attributes that can be separately protected by copyright as a “character.\"\\n\\nThe mechanic joins the world\\'s largest corporation on the outside of the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAlso on Monday, Apple couldn\\'t get the justices to take up a review of its actions in the e-book market.\\n\\nThe case dates back to 2012 when the Justice Department and various state attorneys\\xa0brought legal action after Apple introduced the iPad, launched the iBookstore and came to deals with the biggest book publishers. Apple was accused of working with publishers to set higher price points for e-books than Amazon.com, the leading vendor in the market at that time. By employing \"most favored nation\" contractual clauses, Apple acted as the \"hub\" in a hub-and-spoke antitrust conspiracy, according to the Justice Department.\\n\\nIn June 2015, 2nd Circuit Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston affirmed a district court\\'s ruling that Apple\\'s role as the facilitator of horizontal agreements was\\xa0per se unlawful under the Sherman Act, and that there was\\xa0\"strong evidence that Apple consciously orchestrated a conspiracy among the Publisher Defendants.\"\\n\\nApple urged the high court to see its role more in the vertical rather than horizontal sense and apply a rule of reason approach towards considering\\xa0the pro-competitive results of its conduct. The e-books case, however, won\\'t be the vehicle by which the Supreme Court clarifies the use of contracts between producers and distributors in the antitrust realm.\\n', 'As Bachelor Nation anxiously awaits the season finale next week — in which one lucky woman will receive Ben Higgins\\' final rose — fans were treated to a dramatic reunion\\xa0with season 20\\'s special episode of the annual The\\xa0Women Tell All.\\n\\nOn Monday, the contestants who failed to steal\\xa0Ben\\'s heart dished on what happened behind the scenes, what went wrong with their relationships and what\\'s next on their agendas. Here\\'s a breakdown of the most dramatic moments of the night.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Jubilee is confronted for making racial comments.\\xa0\\n\\nThe show quickly took a serious turn when Jami and Amber called out Jubilee for saying she was \"the real black girl\" on the show. At first, Jubilee tried to dodge the subject.\\xa0But Amber and Jami were not going to let Jubilee off that easy — they asserted that the war veteran at certain points used the \"N-word\" and told them that they were not \"black enough.\" Ultimately, Jubilee admitted that using the term \"full black\" is something she would say, but she tried to\\xa0claim that the phrase is not \"offensive.\" In the end, she plead the fifth and said she would not be \"claiming\" that she ever made those insensitive remarks on The Bachelor.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Lace meets her (creepy) secret admirer.\\n\\nLace — also known as \"50 Shades of Lace\" for her self-proclaimed \"crazy\" personality — had quite the eventful night. Not only did she agree to join the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise, but she also had an unusual encounter with a diehard fan. In the middle of her heart-to-heart with host Chris Harrison, a man jumped up in the audience to proclaim, \"You are crazy. Crazy beautiful. And I don’t want to seem crazy myself but I have to show you this one thing.\" The audience member proceeded to lift up his shirt to reveal a tattoo of Lace\\'s face! (Do you think it was real?)\\xa0The Lace fanatic was lucky enough to snap a picture with his crush\\xa0on-stage after a very cautious Chris\\xa0told him to \"keep your distance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Olivia and Emily get into another catfight.\\n\\nNo surprise here! Olivia and Emily were at it again, but this time, Emily was reunited with her twin sister Haley. The twins ripped into Olivia for \"disrespecting\" the\\xa0women on the show. Plus, Haley could not help but dig into Olivia for stating that she liked \"to talk smart things\" in contrast to her fellow contestants.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n4. A chicken is present.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Sheila\" the chicken interrupted Emily\\'s monologue\\xa0by nearly attacking Lace.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Chris hits a nerve with\\xa0Caila.\\n\\nPoor\\xa0Caila. The software sales rep made it to the Top 3, but was voted off last week in the season\\'s most-emotional goodbye yet. On\\xa0The Women Tell All,\\xa0Caila shared that she still has incredibly strong feelings for Ben, but added that she is hopeful for the future: “I fell in love with him ... It\\'s really hard to watch back, but you know what was really good for me was to see his relationships with Lauren and\\xa0JoJo\\xa0because the way he looks at them, I want someone to look at me that way some day.\"\\n\\n6. Amanda stands up for her babies.\\n\\nYou go, Amanda. The mother of two finally had a moment to address Olivia\\'s quip about her life being like watching a Teen Mom episode. While Olivia was in the hot seat, Amanda stated, “Did you not talk about me and my kids and say that any guy should be running the other way from somebody with kids? Do you not think that’s rude?\" Watch the confrontation unfold in the video below.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\xa0Caila\\xa0and Ben get closure after their tough breakup.\\xa0\\n\\nFinally, Ben stepped out to face the women for the first time since he sent them home. The show\\'s leading man first turned to\\xa0Caila to answer any of her lingering questions and to provide a sense of closure. He turned to her with a heartfelt message, \"I\\xa0hope you know how much I learned from our conversations … We just explored life to a level that I never expected, so I\\xa0appreciate you and I appreciate you coming back here tonight.\"\\xa0\\n\\n8. Leah does not feel bad about lying.\\xa0\\n\\nRemember Leah-the-liar? The contestant from Denver, Colorado had the audacity to interrupt Caila\\'s special moment with Ben to bring up her own drama. Earlier in the season, Leah claimed to Ben that Lauren (who is now in the Top 2) was a different person around him than she was with the other women. Well, believe it or not, Leah still could not let that go. You would think she would take this opportunity to apologize for her actions, but instead she just got angry with Ben for ratting her out.\\xa0\"Why you had to go and tell you know Lauren right away and put me in a position where I had to figure out whether I was going to openly discuss it with all the girls, when nobody else should have been involved, or lie and say that I didn’t talk?\"\\n\\nLuckily, Ben still has his common sense and put Leah\\'s little story to rest.\\xa0\\n\\n“You said something to me that night that was gonna affect another relationship and I had to confront it,\" said Ben. \"I never used your name, but when it was brought up in front of you, your response then was your response and that was up to you.\"\\n\\n9. Olivia apologized to all the women on the show.\\n\\nCan you believed\\xa0this actually happened? A very tearful Olivia turned to the contestants to express her deepest apologies, especially to Amanda and other young moms whom she may have offended.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n10.\\xa0Ben opens up about saying\\xa0“I love you\" to two women.\\n\\nYes, Ben did discuss his shocking decision to tell two women that he loved them, but to be honest — he did not look very guilty about it. Ben seemed too head over heels in love to care much about the matter. He was eager to share with Chris how much he cares about the lady who received the final rose: \"I am more in love than I\\'ve ever been ... I would marry that woman tomorrow if I could.\"\\n\\n11. There are unforgettable bloopers.\\n\\nPossibly the best moment from the show was the hysterical blooper reel. From bugs to booze, watch some of the best of the night.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you look forward to watching Lace on Bachelor in Paradise? What was your take on Olivia\\'s final words on the show? Who do you think will receive Ben\\'s final rose —\\xa0JoJo or Lauren? Share what you think in the comments below.\\xa0\\n', '\\n\\n\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tBy \\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tTambay A.

Jeff Zimbalist and Michael Zimbalist\\n\\n\\nFinally! Three years later...\\n\\nThe Tribeca Film Festival has announced the complete lineups for its Spotlight, Midnight, and Special Screenings programs, as well as the 10th annual Tribeca/ESPN Film Festival, and it\\'s all serious business.\\n\\nOf note, Imagine Entertainment\\'s\\xa0Pelé\\xa0biopic, which will apparently be titled \"Pelé: Birth of a Legend,\" which will make its World Premiere at the festival next month.\\n\\nThe film struggled to find a distributor thanks in part to reshoots and a lengthy post-production phase that caused delays (despite principal photography happening in 2013, the film was only completed just last year);\\xa0also the sales company that was repping the film - Exclusive Media - imploded.\\n\\nThe finished product was shopped at Cannes last year, but there were no takers, and one can only wonder why, given that it\\'s a film about, arguably, the greatest footballer of all time, Pelé\\xa0(born\\xa0Edison Arantes do Nascimento) - a man very well known internationally (even if there may not be as much awareness of him and his accomplishments here in the USA). Add to that, the fact that the film is backed by super producer Brian Grazer\\'s\\xa0Imagine Entertainment.\\n\\nI\\'d guess that\\xa0the film may have lost some of its luster, since it was originally supposed to premiere prior to the\\xa02014 World Cup, to take advantage of what could\\'ve been free advertising, as well as the overall spirit of that summer, which was exciting for sports fans worldwide. But that obviously didn\\'t happen.\\n\\n“Without the World Cup hype as a marketing tool, soccer movies can be very difficult to sell to audiences,” said one European buyer to The Hollywood Reporter\\xa0last\\xa0year - a buyer who was initially interested in the film, but, after screening it, felt it was \"too art house for mainstream audiences and not mainstream enough to play multiplexes in Europe,\" as it\\'s a film that I\\'m sure would likely earn the bulk of its box office outside the USA.\\n\\nAnd the recent FIFA corruption scandal probably didn\\'t help much either.\\n\\nIFC Films eventually acquired North American rights to the film last September, with plans to release the film some time this year.\\n\\nJeff\\xa0and\\xa0Michael Zimbalist\\xa0are co-writers and co-directors of the film which, according to Imagine Entertainment, is\\xa0more of a coming-of-age story that traces\\xa0Pelé\\'s childhood until he won his first World Cup in Sweden at the age of 17.\\xa0Leonardo Lima\\xa0Carvalho plays Pelé\\xa0at age 10 years old, and\\xa0Kevin de Paula, plays Pelé\\xa0from ages 13 to 17, when he won his first World Cup, in 1958.\\xa0\\n\\nVincent D\\'Onofrio,\\xa0Rodrigo Santoro,\\xa0Diego Boneta,\\xa0Colm Meaney\\xa0and\\xa0Seu Jorge\\xa0all round out the cast of the film.\\xa0D\\'Onofrio plays the Brazilian team\\'s coach,\\xa0Vicente Feola\\xa0(when they won the 1958 World Cup), while\\xa0Boneta plays\\xa0Jose,\\xa0Pelé\\'s main competition, who also gave him the nickname \"Pelé\" when they were both kids. Seu\\xa0Jorge plays Pelé\\'s father,\\xa0Dondinho. And Meaney is the British coach\\xa0of the Swedish nation team that lost to Brazil in the 1958 World Cup final -\\xa0George Raynor.\\n\\nThe cast also includes several Brazilian actors in\\xa0Marianna Nunes,\\xa0Milton Goncales,\\xa0Rafael Henrique,\\xa0Marcus Vinicius,\\xa0Julio Levy,\\xa0Thelmo Fernandes,\\xa0Felipe Simas,\\xa0and\\xa0Charles Myara.\\n\\nThe initial 2013 eight-week shoot (Matthew Libatique\\xa0shot it) took\\xa0place\\xa0entirely\\xa0on Pelé’s home turf, in Brazil.\\n\\n\"Pelé\"\\xa0is produced by Imagine Entertainment and Seine Pictures, who successfully acquired the rights to Pelé\\'s life story.\\xa0The film is executive produced by Pelé himself, alongside\\xa0Paul Kemsley\\xa0for\\xa0SLI/Legend 10\\xa0and\\xa0Exclusive Media.\\n\\nWith a distributor now attached and a 2016 release date eyed, at least we\\'re not going to have to wait until the next World Cup, which will be hosted by Russia, in 2018, to finally see the film.\\n\\nAbove is an official image from the film.\\xa0I\\'m looking forward to its first trailer.\\n\\nThe World Premiere screening at Tribeca next month will be followed by a conversation with Pelé himself, who\\'ll be present.\\n\\n\\n', 'The Directors Guild has two new assistant executive directors: Rachel Paster, who will work out of the guild’s offices in New York, and Steven Knauss, who’s assigned to the headquarters in Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We are very pleased to have Rachel and Steven join our senior management team,” said DGA national executive director Jay Roth. “Their labor relations and union experience will be a valuable asset in negotiating and enforcing DGA agreements. We look forward to putting their extensive experience and skills to use in the service of our AD and UPM members.”\\n\\nPaster, who will be involved in the administration of the guild’s film and television agreements and represent assistant directors and unit production managers in the Eastern region, is an attorney with more than 15 years of experience representing unions. Prior to joining the DGA, she was a partner in the labor law firm Lewis, Clifton & Nikolaidis, where she focused on representing labor unions in contract negotiations.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnauss joined the DGA\\xa0in 2013 as a field representative. Prior to that, he held a number of positions in the Nevada and Florida locals of the Service Employees International Union. In his new post, he’ll represent assistant directors and unit production managers in the Western region, serve as the staff liaison to the guild’s Western AD/UPM Council, and oversee matters related to set safety.\\n', '\\n\\nAfter years of waffling, we’re getting a Dark Tower movie. While not the most popular of Stephen King’s stories (with almost sixty novels and over 200 short stories, it’d be like being the most popular Beatles song or Picasso painting), King’s epic fantasy magnum opus has a devout following. Blending Clint Eastwood and Lord of the Rings-style fantasy adventure, the series is the dirty, desperate alternative to the typical Arthurian retelling. \\n\\nAt its core, the story follows Roland Deschain’s quest to find The Dark Tower and take revenge on The Man in Black, a novel-hopping sorcerer whose past includes Roland’s mother and the destruction of his homeland. Deschain is the last gunslinger (the revolver-twirling equivalent to a Knight of the Round Table) trying to reach The Dark Tower, said to be the nexus of all universes, to restore order to his collapsing world. The series spans multiple dimensions, timelines, and reference material (at one point involving Stephen King the real-world author as a character), charming readers with the sheer absurdity of its existence. This thing is almost too weird to exist in book form, let alone on the big screen.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd yet, here we are. What was once in the works as a Javier Bardem-led miniseries is now going to be a 2017 film directed by Nikolaj Arcel, who’s known for co-writing the Swedish The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and directing A Royal Affair (18th century romantic drama), King’s Game (government conspiracy flick), and Island of Lost Souls (crazy fantasy featuring possession and necromancers). If those credits don’t inspire faith, know that veteran writers Anders Thomas Jensen, Akiva Goldsman, and Jeff Pinkner all have a hand in the script. Sure, the last thing Pinkner and Goldsman put out was the abysmal YA-adaptation The 5th Wave, but let’s just hope that was a source material problem.\\n\\nThat said, we already know the writers aren’t shy about straying from the books. They’ve already cast Mad Max: Fury Road’s Abbey Lee as the female lead Tirana, who isn’t a lead at all in the books, but rather an extremely minor henchman in a group called the Regulators. She may be spinning a character named Susannah (a dissociative double-amputee) in a new direction, swapping her race to keep racial tension (an important book component) alive between herself and Idris Elba’s Roland. Perfectly charismatic, Elba’s wordless, macho strength finds its way into most of his roles, from Luther to Beasts of No Nation, but his sly charm (see Prometheus) will add proper depth to the nomadic lead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the other side of morality, Matthew McConaughey‘s The Man in Black – a constantly shifting devil with tons of aliases – is an ageless deceiver and generally sleazy guy. When casting the same role for the TV adaptation of The Stand (novel-hopping, remember?), Stephen King said he wanted someone who “would make the ladies’ hearts go pitty pat, that looked like the type of guy you would see on the cover of one of those sweet, savage love paperback romances”. McConaughey’s transformed from rom-com slacker to stripper to AIDS victim to Lincoln spokesman, showing off a slippery versatility perfect for a trickster. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the other two members of Roland’s group, we can only speculate. While Eddie, a drug mule who functions as a narrative instrument for King’s own battle with drug abuse, could be anyone, I’d love to see Buzzard’s Joshua Burge bring his abrasive desperation to the role. When considering eleven-year-old Jake, the stable, reserved surrogate son of Roland, there’s nobody better than Jacob Tremblay. Just imagine that kid with a pair of pistols.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs to what material the movie will cover, Arcel is vague on the details, saying it’ll skip the beginning, and heavily involve our non-fantasy world. Entertainment Weekly has wisely speculated that the film could be adapting The Waste Lands, the third book, in order to incorporate the group elements of a Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. The Waste Lands, skipping over much of the lone-desert-wanderer material that might not play with popular audiences, finds Roland completing his ka-tet, or crew, by pulling Jake from New York City. Then his party, which in the novel consists of Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy the billy-bumbler (like a raccoon dog with parrot-like speech ability), follows an effective Yellow Brick Road to the Tower. \\n\\nI’m thinking they’ll also grab material from the end of the first book, The Gunslinger, whose opening “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed” served as an accompaniment to the casting announcement of Elba and McConaughey, and the second, The Drawing of Three. Some combination of these books would cover the coalescence of the main characters a la The Fellowship of the Ring, and allow us to jump right into the mythology without flashbacks or lone character wandering.\\n\\nIf you want to prep yourself for this certainly epic film, you’ve got until January 13, 2017 to read up and create\\xa0fan theories of your own. It might just be enough time to get through the eight monstrous books and find out there’s a crazy talking train that tells the ka-tet riddles. So, to sum up: a fellowship made up of a junkie, a gunslinger, a New York kid, and a legless woman follow the path of their destinies to a magical tower which is the center of all realities, combining fantasy, sci-fi, and western genres along the way. Also, an evil talking train.

It\\'s an argument that should, on the face of it, be compelling, if only it didn\\'t run into the problem of Marvel\\'s own back catalog.\\n\\n(Before we go any further though, let\\'s take a minute to state the obvious: Yes, that Spider-Man moment in the new Captain America: Civil War trailer feels like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, \"hey everyone\" was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be. That ending alone makes the trailer — an opinion I\\'m not alone in having, judging by the excitement that\\'s currently visible on social media.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We need to be put in check,\" Robert Downey Jr.\\'s Tony Stark says, and judging by what\\'s previously been seen in the trailer, that\\'s a difficult thing to argue against — we\\'ve not only revisited scenes of mass destruction in New York (Avengers), Washington (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Sokovia (Avengers: Age of Ultron), but we\\'ve also seen that the Avengers themselves can\\'t stand to look at their aftermath. \"Okay, that\\'s enough,\" Captain America (Chris Evans) says, as if it\\'s cruel to remind them of what they\\'ve done.\\n\\n\"Captain, people are afraid,\" General Thunderbolt Ross says, and why shouldn\\'t they be? Well… because the earlier movies suggested that everything was okay and there weren\\'t that many casualties — if any — perhaps? Avengers, after all, didn\\'t end with the heroes mourning those that died during the alien invasion, it ended with the heroes eating shawarma.\\n\\nAge of Ultron spent a large amount of time trying to suggest that civilian casualties were kept to a minimum when the Avengers took on Sokovia, and The Winter Soldier\\'s helicarrier was (a) manned by bad HYDRA agents and (b) went down into the water, not into a populated area. The collateral damage in each of those events was deliberately kept to a minimum, making this fear feel curiously contradictory to what\\'s come before.\\n\\nMarvel is in an awkward place with Civil War, and it\\'s a problem that\\'s demonstrated explicitly in this new trailer. Let\\'s say, for the sake of argument, that you are on Team Iron Man and want to see oversight of superheroes — how does that actually prevent the kind of destruction that it\\'s meant to stop? We see the pro-oversight heroes fight their opposite numbers at an airport, causing explosions and destruction that\\'s just as likely to hurt civilians as anything in Iron Man 3 or Ant-Man. So… unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules, what makes this new status quo better again?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorse still, it also makes the destruction caused by superhero fights foremost in viewers\\' heads again, so that by the time we get to Avengers 5: This Time They\\'re Fighting Kang In The Old West, the audience won\\'t be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the other side of that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?\\n\\n(See also: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which apparently suggests that any massive superhero fight will lead to congressional hearings in future; I look forward to someone trying to explain to the government who Darkseid is in years to come.)\\n\\nIt took decades for comic books to start grappling with the idea of \"real world repercussions\" of the outlandish, oversized conflicts that superheroes bring with them, ushering in an era of increasingly grim, joyless stories. Apparently, superhero movies have managed to get there far quicker. The question is whether movies will find a less depressing solution to the problem than their source material.

Back in 2011,\\xa032 filmmakers including\\xa0Michael Bay, Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron, Michael Mann, Todd Phillips, Antoine Fuqua, Robert Zemeckis, and Guillermo del Toro\\xa0signed their names to an open letter urging Hollywood to abandon plans for a premium VOD service that, at the time, would see theatrical releases available to be ordered by customers at home after sixty days for $29.95. They argued that the model was not sustainable, nor was it good for the moviegoing experience. The filmmakers believed that \"what sells for $30-a-viewing today could be blown out for $9.99 within a few years,\" hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue would be lost, and theaters would close. Now, just five years later, some of the industry\\'s biggest names are backing a premium VOD plan that\\'s even more ambitious.\\n\\nLast week it was reported that Facebook and MySpace tech titan Sean Parker is\\xa0part of a startup called The Screening Room who are busy pitching Hollywood on a plan that would see theatrical movies available day-and-date for $50, with customers purchasing a proprietary box to gain access. The company promised they\\'d be able to handle any threat of piracy, and sweetened the pot for studios and distributors by offering them a generous cut of the action. You might think that filmmakers would see this as a threat to the big screen experience they work so hard to create, but you\\'d be mistaken. \\n\\nVariety reports that\\xa0Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, J.J. Abrams, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard are all shareholders in The Screening Room, with some of them even putting their personal money in the venture. It\\'s frankly a bit surprising to see these filmmakers throw their support behind a program that would arguably erode the moviegoing experience, and turn going to the movies into something a specialty event. But then again, these are exactly the moviemakers who will probably never have to worry about their films not being shown in a multiplex. In fact, it could be argued that its smaller movies that could find theater screens harder to come by in a scenario where theater owners have to work harder to get audiences to show up, and might increasingly choose to program blockbusters that pack the most bang for the buck.\\n\\nTheater chains have yet to comment publicly about this proposed program, but AMC has reportedly shown interest. Perhaps they believe audiences will be willing to pay a hefty price to stay home and watch \"Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice\" (for example) rather than go their cinemas, and/or maybe they just want to make sure they get a piece of pie if and when the landscape of movie watching truly shifts. After all, theater attendance has been pretty stagnant for years, and hasn\\'t show much growth.\\xa0But it is a bit disheartening that rather than try and sustain the moviegoing experience, or improve it, a theater chain is willing to thrown in with a program that would keep audiences away. \\n\\nStudios seem to be interested as well, with\\xa0\\xa0Universal, Fox, and\\xa0Sony\\xa0all apparently somewhat warm to the idea, and perhaps they don\\'t really care how audiences see their releases, just as long as they are paying top dollar for them.\\n\\nIt\\'s certainly an interesting development that some of Hollywood\\'s biggest and most influential names are behind The Screening Room and its plan, but perhaps, better the enemy you know.

For those looking for a powerful directorial debut, there\\'s Trey Edward Shults\\' \"Krisha,\" a Cassavetes-esque drama centered on the eponymous Krisha (Krisha Fairchild) who attends Thanksgiving with her family after not seeing them for a decade. Critics have raved about the film\\'s abiding sense of chaos, how it\\'s borne out of minor incidents and tiny misunderstandings, along with the film\\'s bracing psychological portrait of a wounded woman returning to her humble beginnings. Based on a short film as well as numerous real-life incidents, \"Krisha\" examines a breakdown in real time, using its 83-minute running time to its advantage, and how a tense, charged atmosphere can be just the necessary pressure cooker for someone to let loose their various grievances. Don\\'t be surprised if \"Krisha\" stands as one of the best American indie films of the year.More thoughts from the Criticwire Network:Manohla Dargis, The New York TimesFew movies bore into a character\\'s head as deeply as \"Krisha,\" and with such uncompromising ferocity. A family drama in alternately appalling and queasily hilarious extremis, this bravura first feature takes place over an epically terrible Thanksgiving that may inspire you to start leafing through the collected poems of Philip Larkin, looking for that one about Mum and Dad. It takes some time to grasp who wronged whom here, but it\\'s clear from the get go that serious damage has been done. The young director Trey Edward Shults suggests as much by opening with a close-up of Krisha (played by the director\\'s aunt Krisha Fairchild) staring into the camera, her lined, tanned face framed by a mass of springy gray hair that might as well be a mess of snakes. She\\'s isolated in the shot, and, as she continues to stare and the eerie music gets to shrieking, you might think — it won\\'t be for the first time — that this looks and feels a lot like a horror movie. Though it\\'s one, after a fashion and too many drinks, that finally owes more to the likes of John Cassavetes than the usual genre influences. Read more.A.A. Dowd, The A.V. ClubNamed for its central agent of chaos, herself named for the terrific unknown actress who plays her, \"Krisha\" may be the most explosive family-reunion drama since Jonathan Demme\\'s \"Rachel Getting Married\" — another film, incidentally, about a difficult, destructive relative seeking forgiveness, even as she teeters on the precipice of a relapse. But in this even smaller project, expanded from a short into a first feature by writer-director Trey Edward Shults, tensions don’t just rise with tempers; they’re woven into the very fabric of the film’s style. Take, for example, the film’s second shot, which depicts the arrival of our heroine (Krisha Fairchild): In a single, winding take, she crosses the driveways and manicured lawns of a suburban neighborhood, muttering nervously to herself until she finds the right house. Shults doesn’t even cut when Krisha is finally ushered inside and greeted one at a time by the family. He just sits on the moment, basking in the discomfort. Unfolding across an especially long and awkward Thanksgiving Day, \"Krisha\" creates an audio-visual language of social anxiety; it’s practically a horror movie about the horror of being the unwanted guest at the party. Almost every stylistic choice—most of them quite dynamic, especially for a first-time director—has been made to serve Krisha’s subjective perspective, her “jumpiness.” Rhythmic montages of activity, scored to the atonal plucks of Brian McOmber’s sinister score, somehow turn the mundane activities of a holiday get-together—preparing the meal; watching the big game; horsing around in the yard—into sources of unease. These are private family rituals, not for interlopers. Likewise, several conversations are shot from eavesdropping distance, the camera creeping down hallways or lingering in doorways. \"Krisha\" keeps Krisha always on the outside, unable to participate. Read more.Justin Chang, VarietyKrisha is greeted warmly enough (perhaps a bit too warmly), and she reciprocates with an eagerness to make herself useful, putting herself to work in the kitchen while Robyn heads out to fetch their wheelchair-bound mother (Billie Fairchild, Shults\\' grandmother). As Krisha sets about gutting the turkey, Shults whips the character’s movements into a montage of high anxiety, his swift edits keeping time with the chop-chop-chop of the knife and the percolating rhythms of Brian McOmber\\'s score. By the time the music fades, the cutting slows and the mood relaxes, it\\'s clear that \"Krisha\" means to reveal its protagonist\\'s perspective not through exposition, but in the very texture of the filmmaking — varying its syntax so as to draw us ever deeper into one woman’s profound sense of alienation from those around her. Shults\\'s approach craftily favors observation over exposition, and he proves as attentive to Krisha\\'s surroundings as he is to her inner life; we\\'re made continually aware of the teenagers laughing and goofing off in the background, along with the numerous dogs roaming the property, all of them enjoying the day with enviably carefree abandon. Meanwhile, old resentments spark between Krisha and an ornery, outspoken relative, Doyle (a hilarious Bill Wise), in a long, varied and remarkably improvised conversation that unfolds loosely throughout the film\\'s first half. But perhaps her most awkward and telling interaction occurs with Trey (Shults), a quiet young college student whom she approaches with the insistent warmth of an old friend, yet who obviously wants nothing to do with her.

Nothing against him, but if this movie starred the very talented John Hawkes it would already be one step toward old hat. We\\'ve seen that story before. To cast an older woman with an un-Hollywood body type is itself something of a revolutionary act. Her performance matched with Shults’ unique shooting and editing make this winner of the 2015 South By Southwest grand jury prize one of the essential independent films of the year. That it likely also doubles as therapy for the entire Shults family is a happy residual for them.

This is a game changer; Netflix’s Ted Sarandos got a big ticket feature, and he paid a premium for it. I’m told that Netflix will invest north of $90M in the entire package. That includes north of $3M for the Landis script, making it one of the largest spec deals for a writer in years. The film will cost around $45M to shoot, meaning that just about that much will be invested in talent fees, and also to buy out their back ends; while there could be a limited theatrical launch day and date, Netflix is doing this to serve subscribers to its streaming service in countries around the world and so there will be no backend residuals. This deal dwarfs by one-third the premium that Netflix paid to get the David Michod-directed War Machine, starring and produced by Brad Pitt.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a different kind of coup for Netflix. The package brought heat the moment Deadline revealed it was coming to market on March 2, because Ayer and Smith just completed the Warner Bros/DC film Suicide Squad, which is expected to be a major summer hit. Though it will be R-rated, Bright is much closer to Men in Black‘s commercial qualities and VFX than anything Netflix has done before, and it is meant to launch a franchise. It quickly got reported that Netflix put in a significant bid and won the property, but it wasn’t decided until much much later. The auction took so long because there were at least two other suitors. Warner Bros teamed with MGM, and they were willing to go as high as the high $50M,\\xa0 all in. Also bidding was PalmStar’s Kevin Frakes, who offered $4M for the Landis script and committed to a total budget around $60M. Both of those bids would have been to make a traditional wide release theatrical film. The principals made the decision on Netflix two days ago, and it has taken this long to make the deals, with Landis just closing. The producer deals are still not completely done, but Eric Newman, Ayer, Landis and Bryan Unkeless will share producing duties.\\n\\nThe film will shoot this fall in Los Angeles. The location was important to Ayer, who has made the city a location in all his cop procedurals. I will have more on why the principals took the leap here, but suffice to say, they all embraced the idea of a disruptive model. Netflix made it easier by ensuring they would be compensated as they would have with a hit movie. CAA packaged the deal, repping Ayer, Smith, Edgerton and Newman. WME repped Landis in the script deal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n', ' \\n                 \\n\\n                                                    Reportedly, the filmmakers of \\n\\n (opening March 25) cast \\n\\n as the Dark Knight because they wanted a slightly older Batman with some gravitas.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, you\\'re probably chuckling and thinking, \"Ben Affleck?

Photo by Ale Vulcano, courtesy of The Bogliasco Foundation.\\n\\nIt's one thing to head to the top of the world to shoot at the highest-altitude human settlement, another entirely different to see the result of that shoot projected on a screen. But if the screen is the giant-sized IMAX at Berlin's Sony Center, the experience may be closer than you'd think. Salomé Lamas may look small next to either the top of the world or the IMAX screen, but the Portuguese director, only 29, is a tough cookie behind her apparently fragile and youthful looks, as can be seen from Eldorado XXI, the feature film she shot in the Peruvian mining town of La Rinconada, 5500m high in the Andes—a “nightmarish shoot” by her own admission. (And not the first one. While shooting in Transnistria for another project, the KGB arrested and interrogated her and her crew.) \\n\\nEldorado XXI, an immersive non-fiction essay bridging Werner Herzog's postcards from the edge of human resilience and exploration and Wang Bing's minimalist observations of struggling communities, was one of the high points of a particularly strong line-up in this year's Berlinale Forum, and is now heading to New York's New Directors/New Films. It's the second feature-length work for Lamas after 2012's No Man's Land, an equally fascinating deconstruction of memory and history, reality and fiction, through the direct-to-camera narrative of a Portuguese special forces soldier turned mercenary for hire. \\n\\nA film graduate with a masters in art from Amsterdam and currently a PhD candidate in film studies, as well as a former DAAD Berliner Künstlerprogramm and Rockefeller fellow, Lamas has also a number of short films and video installations and performances under her belt. And while theory underlies all of her work in any format, she always wears it lightly and never forgets there's an audience in front of her that may not be familiar with it. Her cinema is born out of the tension between thinking and doing, looking and sharing. Eldorado XXI widens the scope of that dichotomy, by engaging with the neo-feudal, post-apocalyptic landscapes of La Rinconada's mining facilities and the impoverished communities that survive there as best they can, in a multi-layered exploration of history, politics, society and capitalism that corresponds to Lucrecia Martel's definition of “political cinema” as raising questions and doubts rather than offering cut-and-dried solutions.\\n\\nLamas spoke at the Lisbon offices of production company O Som e a Fúria, in between arriving from France where she supervised Eldorado XXI's post-production, and leaving for Berlin for her film's world premiere. Parts of this interview were first published in and appear courtesy of Público.\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Eldorado XXI premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival's Forum. Is that something you looked forward to?\\n\\nSALOMÉ LAMAS: We did discuss with the producers where we would pitch the film. Within the big carnival that film festivals usually are, the Forum is open to serious work and treats it accordingly. It's a carefully curated section, with a rigor that transcends the mere sidebar within a big festival, and that makes me very comfortable. I feel happy being in the Forum, it's the right place for the way the film turned out, within a family of filmmakers that makes sense to me.\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: The Forum makes a point of looking beyond cinema, into the connections with modern visual and multimedia arts. That's something you do as well, switching between installation work and more traditional film. How do you decide what is the correct form for each project?\\n\\nLAMAS: In the specific case of Eldorado XXI, the original idea was to make a kind of hybrid documentary, with a loose script and characters. But then it moved in other directions. The long shot at the beginning of the film happened because I was thinking of doing a parallel museum piece, but when I came back from La Rinconada I realized that particular shot could very well be a part of the film. From that moment on, I wouldn't use it in a museum piece so as not to cannibalize my work, and that led the film into a more radical, less classical side. That was due in part to my own way of structuring and approaching the picture, but also because we shot in such a difficult place. It was a really troublesome shoot, nightmarish almost. \\n\\nBut back to your question, my studies were originally in cinema and it was only later I did my masters in art, so the installations and gallery work are a more recent development. Probably, though, everything I've ever done has always had that possibility to be presented in either of those venues. \\n\\nSome projects demand a more consistent financing and lead to different results. It's different to go to La Rinconada on your own than to go to La Rinconada with a team after two years waiting for the funding to come. I'm always doing many different projects at the same time. This year I'll spend a month in the jungles of Borneo, and I have another project I want to shoot in the Middle East, between Cairo, Dubai and Beyrouth. Smaller projects that I fund in other ways, but that are necessary to me. Not just for artistic reasons but also so I can have a life like everybody else and a job like everyone else. It's really a way to live your daily life.\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Shooting in the Peruvian Andes is a weird way to live your daily life…\\n\\nLAMAS: But there is a practical side to it. I don't have a romantic vision of filmmaking, I find creativity and talent meaningless words. I'm closer to being a cobbler, working on a craft you have to master in order to improve. It's all about experiences, and storing experiences, and that makes you look differently at everything. I find it utterly condemnable that some directors shoot abroad in a very gratuitous way: there's not enough drama in the Northern Hemisphere or in the place they live in, so they go elsewhere in the world to look for it. Those films are very easy to spot, they're much closer to the militant, campaigning documentary, which doesn't really stimulate me as a viewer. I find lots of ethical problems in them. \\n\\nSo, on one hand, it's all about managing your daily life, and on the other it's about that storing of experiences and your ability to live anywhere, about understanding how other places you can live in interfere with you and you with them. That's where most of the\\xa0 ideas probably present in all my work come from. The sense of waiting, of finding something surprising to me that I may find interesting to record; of me being an alien in a different reality, and how the friction that creates can generate a project, a desire to bring to the forefront realities unknown or forgotten.\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: But a craftsman usually sits at his table, while you travel around the world...\\n\\nLAMAS: That's related to a certain mental confusion, and to my sense of hyper-activity [laughs]. I like paradoxes, I like conflict, though I don't deal at all well with conflict. I don't like to shoot, so I put myself in situations I can't later run away from. Sometimes you need to have some luck for it to work out fine; you have to be on the lookout for something, wait for it to happen, whether premeditated or unexpected. But it's also connected with the inability to separate life from work, and with my need to do several projects at the same time. I may be shooting something in a particular corner of the world and then I come across something that links to something else, so I make a note and save it for a future project. You can't just turn off your brain and say, I'm compartmentalizing this. Everything happens constantly at the same time. \\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Do you find people have a different perception of your work depending on where they come across it first, in the theatre or in the museum?\\n\\nLAMAS: I don't think so, but it is difficult for me to say because I'm the artist. That's something that comes more from critics, or curators, or even the institutions… It's never something I'm worried about. Also, when you are trying to invoke a lineage, that means you're not really interested in the work but in something else. I'm attracted by a series of things related to the ends of the earth, exiled places, margins; I'm always seeking the limits of the forms themselves, whether of non-fiction cinema or of presentation, showing the same work in different contexts. I don't think that theoretical reflection is what gets the films going, though. That comes from a more... kamikaze side of me, slightly irresponsible, though actually very pragmatic. I'm very aware of the risks I'm taking, which are always measured even when I'm pushing physical or geographical limits. \\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Why do you feel attracted toward those limits?\\n\\nLAMAS: I think initially out of curiosity towards people, towards all that's around me, and also with the idea of how to translate reality into a filmic language. \\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Your work invites the audience to experience the journey with you, and not just respond passively.\\xa0 \\n\\nLAMAS: Oh, absolutely, I don't like lazy people. [Laughs] I'm interested in how the perception of the audience changes. I like to push the limits of the audience, whether of appreciation or of understanding. I never liked going to a museum and seeing interactive pieces because they're usually accompanied by instructions on how to interact. I'm more interested in active viewers, and leave others to judge and reflect. Essentially, I ask questions, and questions bigger than myself, and bigger than the audience. There's also something else: a question always has an answer. However, that answer isn't always in the film, or if it is it's hidden in a little box, and it's up to the audience to find it. \\n\\nNOTEBOOK: In shooting in La Rinconada, I'm reminded of Werner Herzog. But his work has a more spontaneous, personal side, while yours is more distanced, very thought through.\\n\\nLAMAS: I'd love to meet Herzog! But I don't know what his spectrum of enthusiasm is. It probably bleeds into the films. I tend to play with the entire spectrum of what enthusiasm or emotion is, but because of the way I tend to look at things, the films look like they're very controlled. That's another paradox. I'm always looking to let go of control, but I need to have a measure of control. I don't know if both things can coexist, but I feel they do anyway... Just because you don't see me jumping for joy, it doesn't mean I don't feel it, I just don't show it outwardly...\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: You keep saying you don't like shooting. Do you take more pleasure in editing?\\n\\nLAMAS: I suppose so. Or maybe that's the way I found to live in the world. [Laughs] I'm always moved by the pleasure of watching, not so much by sharing my way of watching. I take enormous pleasure in watching, but that's never enough. That's why you're always looking for extremes, because it's never enough to just film reality.\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: You make it sound like an addiction...\\n\\nLAMAS: Yes, maybe. But that's also got to do with obsession. You're always trying to go further while knowing full well you'll never go far enough. So it's that thing of the journey rather than the destination being the thing. What matters is that I went to La Rinconada and spent time with those people. And that shapes the film, because the end result is always unpredictable. Beforehand, all I can say is, I'm going to go there and bring a film back. Now the film I bring back can be A, or B, or C… \\n\\nNOTEBOOK: ...but you don't really know until you come back.\\n\\nLAMAS: Precisely. Because very often I haven't even scouted locations, I just get there and set up the camera and shoot in the moment, though that wasn't the case in Eldorado XXI.\\n\\nNOTEBOOK: Do you recognize a through line that connects all your films? Like a worldview of your own?\\n\\nLAMAS: More than I used to, because I'm constantly asked to inscribe myself in a circle or in a world. Also, I can look at my work in other ways after doing Q&A sessions with audiences, or reading or talking with other people after the film is done. I have a lot of fun developing a project on paper, trying to imagine all the possible outcomes of a reality I don't fully know, and all I can do with it. It's a theoretical construct. Then I go out and shoot, knowing full well I'm playing with expectations, not all of which will come true. There's a more emotive, intuitive side to it; you need to react because you don't always have time to think. You need to be there in the moment, aware. Then, when I return home with the material, I can certainly go back to the theory, but that can be dangerous, because theories don't always work in practice. For the editing to work, I find I need to carry over that intuition, that emotional side from the shoot, while needing a structure. You have to accommodate the film so it becomes a film but then, once it's finished and you're free of it, it becomes something else, it's no longer yours. \\n\\nAlso, working with the right people can enrich the film vastly. They will open doors for you and allow you to explore territories you'd be reluctant to explore on your own. A dialogue may allow you to make a suggestion and somebody else will take it to the next level and you'll be thankful they did – that happened in Eldorado XXI with the sound work. You don't always have to have the most brilliant technicians in the world, you just need the right people to understand what you're doing as a person. When the film is done, and it starts being seen and read by the world, then you can go back to the theory, and start thinking how to speak about the film, how to put on paper what happened by impulse. This is one reason why I have a hard time communicating with people during a shoot...\\n\", 'Terry Curtin, a long-serving and highly regarded Hollywood publicist, has been named Head of Theatrical Publicity at DreamWorks Animation, the company announced this morning.

When opened, it\\'s clear this is sensational stuff. The material gets published. Readers flock. And yet, what\\'s put online is called a massive invasion of privacy. A legal missive demands an end to publishing secrets. But it\\'s deemed newsworthy. And the First Amendment protects that, right?\\n\\nNo, not the Hulk Hogan sex tape. We\\'re talking about documents purloined from the Sony hack in November 2014. No, not Gawker. Well, Gawker published hacked information too, but in this instance we\\'re referring to The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Hollywood Reporter — pretty much every news outlet in the country.\\n\\nA Florida jury\\'s $115 million verdict against Gawker on Friday — with punitive damages still to be assessed — compels an examination into what sort of precedent this sets. For decades, thanks to favorable legal decisions such as New York Times v. Sullivan (concerning libel of public figures), New York Times v. United States (the right to publish classified information) and Bartnicki v. Vopper (the right to broadcast illegally recorded communications), media outlets have operated with an air of confidence on materials determined to be in the public interest. Should the press now be concerned about what went down in a Florida courtroom at Hulk Hogan\\'s trial?\\n\\nMany First Amendment scholars will point out that this was merely a trial verdict, one that might not survive Gawker\\'s promised appellate review. The Hogan case is also, in the words of George Freeman, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, one that addresses \"an unusual and extremely private matter.\" That is, a sex tape.\\n\\nThen again, as seen by the Sony hack, news organizations confront all types of objections on privacy grounds. In the digital age, with drones in the sky and biometric-collecting devices on the ground, the issue of ensuring privacy for citizens will surely cause lawmakers and courts to grapple with the boundaries of free speech. During the Hogan trial, a Gawker editor was asked about attitudes on \"revenge porn.\" But the tough issues surely go beyond nudity and sex. For example, just a month ago, NFL superstar Jason Pierre-Paul filed an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit in a Florida court against ESPN and its reporter Adam\\xa0Schefter after a photo of his medical records was tweeted out to 4 million followers.\\xa0\\n\\nWill news of Hogan\\'s victory embolden potential plaintiffs?\\n\\n\"When you see a number like $115 million, sure, it can\\'t help but be an optimistic sign for plaintiffs,\" Freeman tells THR. \"Will it lead to similar cases? The answer is probably yes.\"\\n\\nWhen celebrities and others do sue, the Hogan case may provide another signal of what\\'s to come. While the verdict itself is of limited legal precedent, the nearly-forgotten story of how — and where — it got to trial in the first place provides some.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen Hogan first sued, he did so in federal court by attaching a copyright claim. Thanks to Hogan\\'s settlement agreement with Bubba the Love Sponge, the plaintiff was conferred rights to the sex tape in question. The federal judge, when asked to rule on a temporary restraining order against Gawker, signaled Hogan\\'s uphill battle with word that the publishing of the video excerpt was \"in conjunction with the news reporting function\" and that the \"factual finding supports a colorable fair use defense.\"\\n\\nHogan then switched tactics, making the case more about privacy than property. He re-filed in state court without the federal copyright claim. Gawker then had the case removed back to federal court. But the judge there noted the presence as a co-defendant of Heather Cole (formerly Clem) — Hogan\\'s sex partner in the tape — \\xa0and decided that diversity jurisdiction (and thus a federal court) didn\\'t apply. And so the case was remanded back to a state court.\\n\\nWhy this became important is that it allowed Hogan to fight with a home-field advantage, before a judge, the Pinellas Circuit\\'s Pamela Campbell, who was appointed to the bench in 2006 by Governor Jeb Bush after proving her conservative bona fides\\xa0by representing the parents of Terri Schiavo in a end-of-life case that received national attention. It\\'s also possibly significant that circuit judges in Florida go through elections. In the middle of the Hogan litigation, she was re-elected to a six-year term in 2014. Studies show that elections can shape decisions made from the bench. Campbell has obviously received a great deal of publicity from this Hogan case.\\n\\nBefore trial, Judge Campbell was asked to make all sorts of rulings — including determining what evidence was irrelevant and potentially prejudicial. She also had to tackle Gawker\\'s summary judgment motions to decide whether Hogan\\'s claims should even be tried before a jury. It\\'s easy to fault her for a series of decisions strongly in favor of Hogan, but then again, there\\'s never been a celebrity sex tape trial before. Also, First Amendment boundaries aren\\'t particularly clear-cut on statutes like right of publicity, one of the claims that Hogan was pursuing.\\n\\nOnce the case got to trial, and Gawker met a state court jury, Hogan was able to exploit the overwhelming unpopularity of the news media to his advantage. \"Do you think the media can do whatever they want?\" asked Hogan\\'s attorney Ken Turkel in closing arguments.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that the public has long been skeptical about the trustworthiness and fairness of the media. Public surveys show that the unfavorable rating continues to sink. According to Gallup, just 40 percent of Americans have a \"great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" of confidence in the media. That\\'s down from 55 percent at the turn of the century. The rise of web-based media and no-holds-barred sites like Gawker certainly hasn\\'t helped that perception. The opinion of the media has ebbed so low that Donald Trump has made the need to reshape libel laws an agenda item in his bid for presidency. Just days before the verdict, Republican citizens of Florida overwhelmingly voted to support him.\\n\\nWhat this all adds up to is the prospect of more privacy lawsuits against media defendants in state court before judges who might not be so friendly and before juries who might not be so protective of the rights of reporters and editors to make their newsworthy calls. Even if Trump never becomes president, lawmakers will also be deciding whether to enact legislation to stop frivolous lawsuits targeting speech and save defendants from enduring expensive, harassing litigation.\\n\\nOf course, many lawyers and scholars such as UC Irvine\\xa0law school dean\\xa0Erwin Chemerinsky, believe the only bright line established in the Hogan case pertains to sex tapes, and that Gawker has a good shot on appeal. The potential psychological fallout from the verdict in newsrooms faced with tough decisions about whether to publish privacy-invasive material presents a different analysis.\\n\\n\"Will there be a chilling effect on journalists?\" asks Chemerinksy. \"I\\xa0hope not. I guess editors will have to address that.\"\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tBy \\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tTambay A.

Wonder Woman finally getting her own flick is something that fans have been clamoring for, and we all hope director Patty Jenkins will do the character justice and give fans what they have been cheering for.\\n\\nThe film is already starting off strong with the release of this image (via EW). We get a good look at Diana (Gal Gadot) and the other powerful women of Themyscira. Here, we see her flanked by her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and her aunts Antiope (Robin Wright) and Menalippe (Lisa Loven Kongsli). We are told that all three women have a hand in raising Diana, which causes some conflicts among them. Hippolyta wants to keep her sheltered and protected from the outer world, whereas Antiope is more interested in training the young warrior for battle.\\n\\nThe image is powerful and completely badass. Jenkins is aiming to make the costume design appealing and empowering for women, going for a tough, warrior-like, yet fantasy-inspired look.\\n\\n“It’s total wish-fulfillment...I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time –\\xa0the same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body. That makes them feel like the hero they want to be. And my hero, in my head, has really long legs.”\\n\\nWONDER WOMAN opens on June 23, 2017. What do you guys think?\\n', 'It shouldn\\'t be too surprising that if you have two kinds of regular TV viewers out in the real world — those who give up on shows immediately if the hook isn\\'t set and those who watch every episode no matter what — the same might apply to those of us who are professional TV critics. That said, critics might have a different set of criteria for continuing or not. It\\'s the Peak TV Era after all and some of us believe there\\'s too much television.\\n\\nBeyond quitting a series or not, there are other fundamental quandaries that both regular TV viewers and critics alike face all the time in the gray-area world of our changing television landscape. THR TV critics Tim Goodman and Daniel Fienberg knocked around some ideas, thoughts and theories on the subject:\\n\\nTim Goodman: Please tell me you stopped watching Heartbeat after your pretty savage review of it. Because if you didn\\'t, we might not be able to have this conversation.\\n\\nDaniel Fienberg: I have a hard-and-fast policy that if I\\'m reviewing a show, I\\'ll watch as many episodes as the networks give me, and often that ends up being a masochistic gesture. So I watched three episodes of Heartbeat and that will be it for me. I didn\\'t need to watch Fuller House beyond the six episodes Netflix made available, and if Netflix hadn\\'t made the entire eight-episode run of Flaked available, I could have stopped, but instead I watched all of it. But I don\\'t have the same policy regarding continuing to watch after screeners if I think that what I\\'ve seen seems to be representative of the show\\'s potential — and if there are no points of genuine curiosity, I don\\'t need to watch more. When it comes to Heartbeat, I\\'ve seen what I need to see and I needn\\'t see any more.\\n\\nOn the other hand, The Catch, which also premieres this week, had a bad pilot, but it was a bad pilot that suggested potential for a lot of creative redevelopment and reconception. ABC only made one episode available, but I will watch another couple of episodes, just because I don\\'t feel like I\\'ve seen the show and I want to see what it settles into. Will you be checking back in on The Catch? Is my policy hopelessly naive and time-absorbing?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodman: Well, I won\\'t comment on \"naive\" but it\\'s definitely \"time-absorbing\" and, perhaps, masochistic. I have no such rule. I do loathe when networks only send one episode because pilots are problematic. That said, I can\\'t help broadcast television stop killing itself slowly. And the time I invested in The Catch will never come back. Besides 1) Why would anyone watch after that? 2) While I do love some network shows as pure escapism — NBC\\'s The Blacklist, CBS\\' Elementary and Person of Interest — the Shondaland stuff is really not for me. And while I admire your, ahem, insane devotion to watching everything you\\'re sent, pre-review, I find there\\'s never an exact number of episodes that it takes for me to form the opinion I then take into the review. For example, I\\'ve seen shows so heinous I can\\'t make it through the pilot. That\\'s my \"I don\\'t have to put my hand in the fire to know it\\'ll burn me\" rule. Other times, I may have six episodes and know by the fourth that I love it and I\\'m ready to write. Because of deadlines or life, I may not have time to watch the other two when I need to file and move on.\\n\\nBut this brings up a couple of issues that we should probably address. First, I\\'m not sure most people, outside of critics, would watch four episodes of a show they don\\'t like just to get to the turning point that makes it good — or even great. It\\'s my firmly held belief that time is the most precious commodity for regular working folks, and in some way part of our job, in this Too Much Television world, is kind of a PSA on how not to waste time on crap. Of course, I\\'ve seen plenty of shows that really do get great after four episodes. You might have some in mind? I wonder, though, if those shows (those creators, those channels, etc.) have the luxury in this competitive environment to become great that late.\\n\\nFienberg: I don\\'t think people have time to watch crap, but I do think that even more than professional viewers do, audiences latch on to a thing or two that they love and that makes the show, more than if the show itself becomes empirically \"good.\" I\\'m a firm believer that nearly every show has a \"best\" version of itself and a \"worst\" version, and if I can see the best version peeking around the corner, I\\'ll wait for it. And wait for it. And wait for it. It took me two full seasons to give up on The Blacklist ever becoming more than a James Spader showcase and then to decide I\\'d seen him do his thing enough, so I could quit. I\\'m happy I\\'ve stuck with Limitless this season, because even if its best self is just a fun procedural with occasional inspiration, I like that. Whereas I keep watching Quantico and Blindspot for no discernible reason. You liked both of those two more than I did in the fall, but have I outlasted you?\\n\\nSometimes it just takes a few episodes to get into the rhythm of a show, whether it\\'s me not quite grooving on it or the creators not settling into the groove immediately. Baskets has gone from a show I found odd to a show whose oddness I embraced to a show that, as its ending its first season, I actually love. You reviewed and didn\\'t like Baskets when it premiered. Have you stuck with it? What does it take to get you to revisit a You\\'re The Worst or a Happy Valley?\\n\\nGoodman: I kept with Quantico and Blindspot (more the latter) until it was clear they were just going to be mysteries with never-answered questions and, worse, stupid in the process. This from the guy who still watches The Blacklist. But Spader can make up for a lot — I guess that\\'s my latch-on point. And while we can\\'t paint all viewers with the same brush, the feedback I get from lots of people is 1) they are incredibly overwhelmed with choices and just want a handful of new things they can get into (they want the best of the best, so I\\'m always aware of that and never recommend series still trying to find themselves) and 2) having not much \"free\" time in their lives to invest in a show, a lot of people I know opt out of certain series, even excellent ones like The Americans, if they don\\'t immediately get into it.\\n\\nAnyway, that last point of yours is interesting. I liked some of the quirk on Baskets (mainly Louie Anderson) but found it both unfunny and the main character, played by Zach Galifianakis, was relentlessly unlikable. A show like that — and I watched four episodes — makes it a very long shot that I give it another chance. And I\\'m not seeing the passionate, sustained support for it that was popping up in the ether (or my Twitter feed) like there was for You\\'re the Worst. And in fairness, I only saw two episodes of You\\'re the Worst and kind of liked the second — going back to revisit revealed I clearly made a mistake in my quick judgment. Same for Happy Valley — one and a half episodes, I think, as I was sampling to see if I should review the first season. I was really busy and passed on it because it didn\\'t strike me as fresh or different. Clearly that was more of a pop-in-and-see, flash decision situation, and I\\'m truly happy I went back.\\n\\nAre there series you\\'d do that with? I was going to give Daredevil another chance because people said it got better in the first season — but I saw lots of bad reaction to the deeper episodes of season two, and I\\'m glad I skipped. In this hectic environment, I think that\\'s time saved. Looking back, another series I didn\\'t have to review and thus shunted to the side was Sense8, which I revisited and really unexpectedly enjoyed.\\n\\nFienberg: Baskets was always going to be an acquired taste, and I\\'m not surprised it hasn\\'t caught on like You\\'re the Worst, which is a much more accessible show. Personally, I think Baskets is much better than the first You\\'re the Worst season, but you needn\\'t revisit, because there\\'s nothing worse than people getting cult-y about a show and then you revisit it with higher expectations that can\\'t be attained.\\n\\nTake something like The 100. The first five or six episodes are genuinely awful, but enough people insisted it got better that I revisited and you know what? It did get better. But even while acknowledging and knowing that it wasn\\'t the inept show that premiered, I wasn\\'t coming close to feeling the passion that fans were feeling, and I petered out midway through the second season because there was something it just wasn\\'t doing for me. I\\'m grumpy enough as is and I don\\'t need to watch a show that I\\'m a 5 or 6 on, hoping it\\'ll become a 10 for me. Of course, there are a lot of shows that I\\'m a 3 or 4 on that I still watch.\\n\\nSomeday I want to go back and watch Spartacus from the point that people insist it got good, even though those opening episodes were so bad. But there are a bunch of shows that I liked much more, but never finished or caught up on. You mentioned Sense8 and that\\'s one where I got to halfway through the first season, but never finished. It\\'s a much better show than Nashville or The Walking Dead, but I\\'m caught up on those.\\n\\nDoes comedy versus drama make a difference in terms of how quickly or slowly you give up?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodman: Let me save you some time with Spartacus — it never got better. It was and remains homoerotic blood porn, badly written and, for the most part, acted. The 100, however, is a great example of what it takes (and whether it\\'s worth it) to go back and \"discover\" shows you might have passed on. Based on the hoopla, I did go back and just like you suffered through the early half of season one (most people should just watch the pilot and skip deep into the first season somewhere), only to like where it was going and watch it become something much better in the second season and early third season. I say early third season because even though the show is probably at its best right now, I haven\\'t kept up because, all together now: There\\'s too much television.\\n\\nSo, was it worth it? As a critic, sure, just to be able to tell people a really bad show became pretty damned good. I\\'d say it\\'s more a 7 on your scale, but even then is that a show I\\'d tip people with time constraints toward rather than, say, The Americans or 20-plus other series? Probably not. But again, I doubt that superfans of The 100 will take my advice and watch Happy Valley. I ended up liking Sense8 because, visually, there\\'s really nothing like it. Plus, it\\'s bold and felt different — I\\'ll take that combo. In comparison, another Netflix show, Bloodline, was harder to endorse because, well, it takes forever to go beyond good and become interesting. Still like it, but not my first — or 15th— recommendation to people.\\n\\nI can\\'t remember if you loathe the saying \"comedy is subjective\" or not, but I\\'m fine with using it and believe it. I just couldn\\'t get some people to like or laugh along to Arrested Development, which is Hall of Fame first ballot; I\\'m not sure I can even be around people who don\\'t like that (or 30 Rock). I\\'ll sample comedies frequently but will also bail earlier because I know almost immediately whether I\\'ll like it or not. I\\'m not a fan of shows I know you like, such as Mom or Big Bang Theory, but you\\'ve convinced me to start watching The Carmichael Show and I think we\\'re both constantly touting stuff like Fresh Off the Boat and Black-ish. But I think quantity fatigue also sets in for comedies, right? I really like Broad City but sometimes just can\\'t get motivated. I mean, the DVR stacks up with tons of stuff, and Veep and Silicon Valley, two shows I wouldn\\'t miss on the night they air, haven\\'t even started yet. Same with Archer. And I need to catch up on Sunny. Lots of excellent stuff out there, but so, so much of it.\\n\\nFienberg: I don\\'t think I ever told anybody I like Big Bang Theory. I don\\'t dislike it, either. In fact, I almost never give positive or negative reactions to it, though I\\'ve become increasingly sick of the show\\'s inability to do anything that isn\\'t stereotypical with Raj, even after 200 episodes. Big Bang Theory is one of seemingly dozens of half-hours that I record and watch each week because a 20-minute network comedy requires precious little effort to have on in the background, even if I\\'m waiting for a great cast to overcome mediocre writing, like with Life in Pieces, or waiting for a once-great show to reach its end, like with Modern Family, or all those years I watched How I Met Your Mother even when it was one of the worst shows on TV. So I\\'m actually never behind by more than an episode or two on any of my comedies, even if I have 10+ episodes of The Vampire Diaries piling up on my DVR.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s all the reality stuff I still watch, mostly Survivor, The Amazing Race, Top Chef and the dying gasps of American Idol, stuff I stick with even through bad seasons, though I think I\\'ve quit two or three reality shows in the past few years. And you don\\'t have any of those, do you?\\n\\nAnd don\\'t knock homoerotic blood porn. We both spend a fair amount of time watching sports.\\n\\nSo is the lesson of this conversation: \"Tim quits things, Dan doesn\\'t, but neither is a path to bliss, at least if you trust our Twitter feeds\"?\\n\\nGoodman: I think we maybe just proved there is no right way to go about it, but there\\'s a lot of opportunity to waste a big chunk of your life in this new TV landscape. All we can do is tell people to choose wisely by pointing out what\\'s worth their time. After that, anything that we don\\'t agree with can be used for mocking on Twitter, yes. Or maybe we just point to the hourglass of their lives and shake our heads knowingly. Meanwhile, I think we just got ourselves way behind on some shows.\\n', 'Author Jim Harrison, whose 1979 novella “Legends of the Fall” was made into the 1994 movie that helped turn Brad Pitt into a Hollywood superstar, died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Arizona.

Both Pokaski and Green recognized this as a story that hadn’t been properly depicted, on television or in entertainment generally, and that part of the reason for this is that the true stories of the slaves in this time are, for the most part, hidden. Indeed, these aren’t stories you necessarily read about in history books, but are rather buried within libraries and archives.\\n\\n“We found these Library of Congress narratives of people who were actually there. It was a treasure trove if you knew where to look,” says Pokaski. As the amount of stories expanded, the cast did as well, though the strategy and the mission remained the same. What you want is every character to be complicated, to surprise you when you’re writing and when you’re watching,” says Green, who noted that even the show’s slave owner roles were dimensionalized and given great thought.\\n\\nNot content with taking the easy way out or settling for the simplest answer, the creators of Underground set out to be bold with not only their visual and story-telling choices, but their choice of music as well. Though the creators took few liberties with the narrative of the Underground Railroad, there is one admitted exception to that. “Kanye (West) was not in 1857,” jokes Green. In their contemporary score, the creators found a new avenue into creating a necessary sense of urgency around the material.\\n\\nIndeed, to Green and Pokaski, the show could not possibly be more resonant and relevant in today’s world of political and social upheaval — in which racism remains a reality. “We were looking at papers describing why slavery had to exist for the economy, and you could remove certain words and it would be about the minimum wage being raised,” said Pokaski, addressing parallels to current economic issues in America. In a world in need of great reform, Green was inspired by the ability and determination of those slaves escaping on the Underground Railroad, and those helping them along the way to change the course of history. “We talk about ‘how active is your activism?’ – with these people, the odds were against them, but they were moving the needle of history,” she says. “I think we’re telling part of a struggle that’s still going on,” adds Pokaski. “And that’s important.”\\n', 'The premise of Lifetime’s UnReal\\xa0was very real at a certain point in time for co-creator/executive producer Sarah Gertrude Shapiro. At Deadline’s The Contenders Emmys event Sunday, she shared. “I was a feminist and came out to L.A. with dreams of feminist filmmaking dancing in my head…I was going to make really important stuff and change.” In search of a day job, she ended up as a producer on The Bachelor\\xa0for nine seasons, where she became\\xa0“a mastermind at manipulating and destroying women.” After having a nervous breakdown,”I went to my boss and said, ‘I’m going to kill myself.’ ” Eventually, she managed to get out of her contract by leaving the state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShapiro’s experience sounds much like UnReal‘s lead\\xa0character Rachel (played by Shiri Appleby), who, as executive producer Stacy Rukeyser described it, is a complicated woman with a “very intense internal conflict\\xa0in that she is really good at what she does and she hates herself because of it. She desperately wants to leave, but she continues to stay because it feels good to be good at something and to have a place where you belong, and that is essentially the touchstone for us on the show.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I\\xa0think you are able to enjoy your favorite show on a whole other\\xa0level,” exec producer\\xa0Carol Barbee said about\\xa0UnReal‘s perspective on\\xa0reality shows. “I\\xa0think it’s really compelling. People want to know how the sausage is made.”\\n\\nWhen asked about the response the show received from people that had worked in the reality TV\\xa0genre, exec producer\\xa0Robert M. Sertner claimed that it had been positive.\\xa0“It’s unbelievable how everyone says, ‘This is how it is.’ “\\n\\nSeason 2 of UnReal premieres June 6.\\n', '\\n\\nWe got our first glimpse of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them nearly four month ago with a teaser that laid out the basics of the plot — in the early 20th century, someone has crossed the ocean from England to America and entered New York City with a case full of magical creatures. Worse, some of them have apparently escaped.\\n\\nNow a\\xa0somewhat more complete picture has arrived via the first full trailer that introduces our protagonist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) along with a little bit of his history. It seems Newt has been expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and rather than earn an online degree or attend a community college he heads off to America with his beasts in tow. Take a gander at the latest chapter from the magical wold of\\xa0J.K. Rowling\\xa0below.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, it very much looks like a Harry Potter movie sans Harry Potter and friends.\\n\\nDirector David Yates is no stranger to Rowling’s\\xa0world having already directed four of the Harry Potter films, but this is the author’s first stab at scripting one herself. Rowling’s screenplay is loosely based on her own book of the same name, but as it’s an incredibly slim volume more focused on\\xa0being a reference tome than a narrative she’s clearly had to liven things up a bit in the story department. Story and character are her bread and butter though, especially where magic is concerned, so we expect this adventure to be every bit as immersive as those she’s most famous for.\\n\\nWhile the presence of magic and muggles remains alongside all manner of creative terminology, the big difference here is the focus on adults. Gone are the pre-teens growing into their abilities and responsibilities, and in their place sits\\xa0a mid-thirties Redmayne with short pants and disheveled hair. Readers who grew up with Potter should be down with it all, but we’ll be curious to see if it’s able to grab the young viewers previously prone to repeat viewings.\\n\\nThere’s still plenty here for those of us far less familiar with Rowling’s writings as the film looks to be a fun adventure with a stellar supporting cast. Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Ron Perlman, and Katherine Waterston are all appealing performers, but I’m most excited to see Colin Farrell back in action with what I’m pretending is a crossover with Winter’s Tale. 1920’s New York City, magic, and a questionable haircut? Surely this is no coincidence. Please god let this not just be a coincidence…\\n\\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens November 18th.\\n', '\\n\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tBy \\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tIndiewire\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\t|\\n        \\t\\t\\t\\tIndiewire\\nWed Apr 13 11:02:21 EDT 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t        \\tStay up to date on all of today\\'s buzziest industry news below.\\n\\n00000154-101c-d27c-a9f7-513df4230000\\n\\nThe 2016 Cannes Film Festival has started rolling out the first of its many upcoming slate announcements with the release of its shorts program.

It had been reported that the UK government, currently in the midst of a top to tail review of the BBC and its operations and funding, was considering pushing the broadcaster to sell its stake in the group, which owns ten channels, including Dave and Alibi. \\xa0Scripps has previously had a £500 million to take full control of the group rejected. Culture secretary John Whittingdale, who is seen as a hawk in terms of reducing the BBC’s scale and scope, is believed to be in favour of a sale that generates upfront revenues. BBC Worldwide’s UKTV stake accounts for a third of its profits. \\xa0BBC Worldwide gives some $330 million a year back to the public license fee-funded BBC through its commercial activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nA BBC spokesperson said: “While the BBC has not seen any drafts of the White Paper, these proposals do not reflect the discussions we have had with Government on its content.”\\n\\nA UKTV sale could be a potentially critical blow to BBC Worldwide, which has already pledged to give over £1 billion over the next five years towards the BBC’s funding. The BBC is under pressure to find alternatives to the current funding mechanism, whereby the public pays for the organisation through an annual license fee.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest report, which first surfaced in the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday Times, is the latest reflection of the tightening noose around the BBC’s current structure. Last month, an independent report recommended the abolition of the BBC Trust.\\xa0The report, which forms part of the UK government’s review of the BBC charter, proposed doing away with the BBC Trust, which currently oversees the BBC’s internal machinations, and with it 94 years of self-regulation. Instead, communications regulator Ofcom should be responsible for all oversight at the public broadcaster according to the report’s author, David Clementi, who has previously served as\\xa0chairman of Virgin Money and Prudential, as well as\\xa0deputy governor of the Bank of England.\\n\\nhere needed to be “fundamental reform of the system of governance and regulation,” said Clementi in the report, which criticized the BBC Trust for its role as “cheerleader and regulator” leading to confusion about where its ultimate responsibilities lay.\\xa0“The BBC Trust model is flawed: it conflates governance and regulatory functions within the Trust, which leads to confusion about the Trust’s role,” stated the\\xa0report.\\n\\nLast year, the corporation had to announce cuts of more than 1,000 jobs\\xa0as part of a restructuring caused by a $234 million gap in license-fee income for 2016-2017 as well as face a bill in excess of $1 billion for new welfare charges. The public broadcaster was also\\xa0asked to absorb the cost of the license fee for viewers over age 75 as the government shifted the cost, previously\\xa0covered by the Department for Work and Pensions, off its books.\\n\\nThe pubcaster remains\\xa0under pressure to find alternative ways to fund its operations. A report last year\\xa0from the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport\\xa0Select Committee said the TV\\xa0license is “becoming harder and harder to justify.”\\n\\nCulture Secretary John Whittingdale, under pressure himself following\\xa0recent allegations about his private life, is expected to publish his proposals in a white paper next month.\\n', '\\n        Admitting it \"failed\" in an earlier attempt to devise a formula, the Board of Governors is explaining to its members how it will decide who is \"active\" in the business, leaving the final determination up to each of its 17 branches.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmitting that it “failed” in its original attempt in January to devise a “one size fits all rule” regarding the voting rights of its members, the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has sent a new letter to its members clarifying how voting status will be determined and leaving it up to the organization’s 17 branches to devise their own particular rules for their members.\\n\\nAcknowledging “some anger and frustration” on the part of members who feared losing their voting status because they had retired or who felt they were being accused of racial bias in their choice of Oscar nominees, the letter seeks to reassure the membership by stating, “If you have spent a lifetime in motion pictures, you will not lose your vote.” It further emphasizes, “You will not lose your voting privileges simply because you’re retired or haven’t been active for a while. There is nothing ageist about this. In fact, these new guidelines advantage those with longer careers over shorter careers.”\\n\\nThe letter then lays out in detail a process for determining voting eligibility that it says is “fair, inclusive and transparent.”\\n\\nThe Academy will use what it calls “activity” in the film business as its first criterion in determining voting rights. But it is now explicitly setting out how that “activity” will be determined. This year’s new members, the letter explains, will be given an automatic right to vote for 10 years, but the clock starts ticking on that 10-year term not when the member is admitted, but from an earlier period when the member completed what it calls “first qualifying work.” Since many members often have a significant body of work by the time they’re invited to join the Academy, by linking voting eligibility to earlier work, the Academy will be giving members credit for previous years’ activity in the business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA member who has been active during his or her first 10-year term will have voting rights renewed for a second 10-year term, and if they remain active during that term, their voting rights will be renewed for a third 10-year term, and if they’re active during that term, they will be vested with lifetime voting rights. The Academy said the three 10-year terms don’t have to be consecutive, but that alternatively a member could secure lifetime voting\\xa0rights in as few as 21 years after a “first qualifying work.”\\n\\nIn order to apply the new rules retroactively to existing members, the board said, it will rely on each of its branches to decide what counts as an individual member’s “first qualifying work.” “The idea here,” the letter said, “is to specifically design the criteria so they’re fair and inclusive to each branch.\"\\n\\nFor example, it notes since production designers often do not earn their first production designer credit until well into their careers, the designers branch could choose a different point in a designer\\'s career as a \"first qualifying work.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, it acknowledges that producers, writers and others can work for years without earning screen credits, “so those branches will come up with their own definitions, based on employment and not screen credit, to make sure that people who remained active for a full career don’t lose their vote.”\\n\\nAnd, as previously stated, members who receive an Oscar nomination will automatically earn lifetime voting rights.\\n\\nAccording to the letter, the Academy’s bylaws have not guaranteed lifetime voting rights since the Academy underwent an earlier review of its membership in 1970. But the new rules will guaranteed lifetime voting for those who qualify under the rules.\\n\\nThe letter concluded by saying the new rules about voting rights are not part of its ongoing diversity initiative. “This initiative, required by our bylaws, has to do with relevance,” the board said before concluding, “adhering to our existing bylaws in this regard is our best assurance that we will continue to retain the crucial relevance of our awards, and continue to maintain the Academy’s standard of excellence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe complete text of the Academy\\'s letter follows:\\n\\n\\n\\tA letter to Academy members from the Board of Governors\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tThere has been a lot of confusion about what we\\'re planning to do regarding voting status, and this has resulted in some anger and frustration. Some members feel they will lose their voting privileges simply because they\\'re retired. Some feel they are being accused of racial bias. Others feel they are being cast as \"over the hill.\" None of these is true. In fact, most members who fear losing their vote, will not. So we want to clear up this confusion and ease your concerns.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tLifetime voting will be for \"lifers.\" If you have spent a lifetime working in motion pictures, you will not lose your vote. We\\'ll describe below how each branch will create the criteria to judge its members fairly and liberally, but we want you to know that the only members who will be moved to Emeritus status will be those who worked in motion pictures for a relatively short time, and then moved on to other things a long time ago. Voting will be for those who are — or were — the most active in motion pictures.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tFirst, a little background. In 1970, the Academy passed a rule, still in our bylaws, stating that voting status is primarily for members who \"continue to be active in the field of theatrical motion pictures.\" Further, the bylaws require that members\\' voting status \"be subject to continuous review by the Board of Governors which shall make transfers of members from one classification to another as it deems advisable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tIn other words, our bylaws have not allowed lifetime voting privileges for anyone since 1970. But they will now.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tYou will not lose your voting privileges simply because you\\'re retired, or haven\\'t been active for a while. There is nothing ageist about this. In fact, these new guidelines advantage those with longer careers over those with shorter careers.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tIn addition, the bylaws allow for other criteria than just \"activity.\" These include members who are \"highly qualified to vote on the Academy\\'s several awards, have continued to be credited with outstanding screen achievements, or otherwise have achieved such unique distinction, earned such special merit or made such a substantial contribution to the motion picture arts and sciences, as to warrant continued active membership.\"\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tSo while \"activity\" remains our first criterion, your branch can take other factors into account as well to allow you to retain your voting privileges. Again, we want voting for those who are, or were, the most active, but we also want to be inclusive and fair. The benefit of the doubt goes to the member.\\n\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s how the rules will work.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tBeginning with this year\\'s class, new members will be given an automatic ten-year term of voting privileges, starting not at time of admission, but at an earlier point: \"first qualifying work\" (see below). If they are active in motion pictures during this first ten-year period, they will automatically be granted voting privileges for a second ten year term. If they are active at all during that second term, they will receive a third ten-year term. If they\\'re active at any time during that third term, they will be vested with lifetime voting rights. (The three ten-year terms do not have to be consecutive, and if you do the math, you\\'ll see that the requirement can be met in as little as 21 years from \"first qualifying work.\") In addition, if they ever receive an Oscar nomination, they will be vested with lifetime voting privileges. That\\'s how new members will be treated from this year on. Now, here\\'s how we\\'ll apply these very inclusive standards to current members.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tIn our initial resolution we tried, but failed, to come up with a \"one size fits all\" definition of activity that could fairly be applied Academy-wide. That was the language that unintentionally caused so much confusion and anger. So we\\'re fixing that.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tJust as with new members, we will not start the first \"ten-year clock\" at the beginning of your membership, which for many, occurred well into your distinguished careers. We will start the clock at your \"first qualifying work.\" And here\\'s more good news: We will also let each branch decide how to define what it means to remain \"active.\" The idea here is to specifically design the criteria so they\\'re fair and inclusive for each branch. And finally, all members will have the right to appeal any decision regarding voting status directly to their peers on their branch\\'s Executive Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\tHere are some examples.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tQuite a few branches can easily define their criteria by screen credits. But producers, writers, and others, can work for years without getting credit. So those branches will come up with their own definitions, based on employment and not screen credit, to make sure that people who remained active for a full career don\\'t lose their vote.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tMany Production Designers do not get their first Production Designer credit until well into their careers, so requiring them to have three ten-year terms since their first Production Designer credit would be unfair. That branch will define another starting point to allow people with full careers to keep their vote.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tIn the next two months, each branch\\'s executive committee will come up with its own way of defining these things, so that it\\'s eminently fair and inclusive for their members. Members will be informed of their voting status by the end of July.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tAgain, the philosophy here is that lifetime voting is for people who put a lifetime into motion pictures.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tThose members who will be moved to Emeritus status will be only those few who both have not worked in a long time AND who did not work for a long time when they were active. There are members who had relatively short careers, then moved long ago to other professions; that\\'s who we will look to move to Emeritus status.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tFinally, why are we doing this? Despite what you may have heard, and despite the timing of our announcement, this proposal is actually not about diversity. We have other proposals to advance the growth of diversity. This initiative, required by our bylaws, has to do with relevance. One of the reasons the Oscar is considered the most important award in motion pictures is because of who votes for it. As long as everyone understands that we keep voting privileges for those who are — or were — the most active in motion pictures, we will retain their confidence, and the awards will retain their enormous value. But if people are asking why someone with a short career many years ago is still voting for the Oscar after moving into an entirely different profession, it calls into question the relevance of that vote and the importance of the awards.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tSo, bottom line: If you satisfy the minimum requirements of career activity as determined by your own branch colleagues, or it is determined that you qualify by the other standards, you will keep your vote. If you haven\\'t been active for a long time, and weren\\'t that active to begin with, you might not. Adhering to our existing bylaws in this regard is our best assurance that we will continue to retain the crucial relevance of our awards, and continue to maintain the Academy\\'s standard of excellence.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tWe hope this reassures you that the process will be fair, inclusive, and transparent. Almost all the decisions will be made at the branch level, where your colleagues best understand a career like yours and why you qualify for voting privileges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nNBCUshortfest.com\\nNBCUniversal Short Film Festival\\n\\n\\nShort film directors, if you dare to dream of being the next Tina Fey, have we got a contest for you.\\n\\nNBCUniversal has announced that its 11th annual Short Film Festival is now accepting submissions.\\n\\nThe diversity-seeking\\xa0festival is \"a nationwide search for talent both in front of and behind the camera, focused on discovering the next generation of storytellers.\" The fest seeks narrative content made within the last two years in drama or comedy categories.\\xa0\\n\\nThis year, the festival will\\xa0allow stand-alone web series episodes and also extends the maximum length of submissions to 22 minutes to allow for comedic pilot presentations.\\xa0\\n\\nThe goal, NBCUniversal says, is \"to not only celebrate up and coming directors, writers, producers and actors, but to introduce them to top industry taste makers while awarding prizes ranging from camera packages and monetary grants to development meetings and holding deals.\"\\xa0\\n\\nLast year, they partnered with Geena Davis and the Oxygen Network to award one female filmmaker with a prize package including a multitude of camera equipment, a\\xa0new iMac computer, as well as development meetings with top executives at the network.\\n\\nThe submissions window is open from now until May 15.

Well, someone certainly took notice — Darren Aronofsky. And he\\'s helping Schipper get his next movie off the ground.\\n\\nCineuropa reports that Schipper will direct \"Undeniable,\" an adaptation of the memoir \"Denial\" by Jessica Stern, with Aronofsky producing through his Protozoa Pictures banner. The book tells the story of how the author and her sister were raped as teenagers, and were initially met with doubts when they reported the crime to police. Over three decades later, she asked the police to complete the file on her case, and shared her experiences about the long lasting effects of trauma. Here\\'s the book synopsis: \\n\\nOne of the world’s foremost experts on terrorism and post-traumatic stress disorder investigates her own unsolved adolescent sexual assault at the hands of a serial rapist, and, in so doing, examines the horrors of trauma and denial.\\n\\n“I have been quiet, and I have listened all my life. But now, I will finally speak.”\\n\\nAlone in an unlocked house in a safe neighborhood in the suburban town of Concord, MA, two obedient, good girls, Jessica Stern, 15, and her sister, 14, were raped on the night of October 1, 1973. When they reported the crime, the police were skeptical. Their father, away on business, did not return for three more days.\\n\\nFollowing the example of her family, Stern—who lost her mother at the age of three—denied her pain and kept striving to achieve. But while her career took off, her success hinged on her symptoms. After her ordeal, she could not feel fear in normally frightening situations. Stern thought she’d disassociated from the trauma altogether, until a request took her back to that night more than 30 years earlier.\\n\\nThe world-class social scientist and expert on terrorism and post-traumatic stress disorder began her own investigation, with the help of a devoted police lieutenant, to find the truth about her rapist, the town of Concord, her own family, and her own mind. The result is DENIAL, a candid and deeply intimate look at a life, a trauma, and its aftermath.\\xa0\\n\\nSchipper penned the first draft of the screenplay, but Abi Morgan (\"Shame,\" \"Suffragette\") is going to write the final script. It sounds like a potentially powerful story, with a lead role that should likely attract some A-list attention.\\n', 'Netflix gets all the love, but Amazon does have a competing streaming video service called Amazon Prime (which I\\'ve been a subscriber of for a few years), and it too does refresh its monthly offerings just like Netflix.

The relationship further deteriorated when Strahan\\xa0was named a correspondent on GMA in 2014. Ripa felt, according to a source close to the show, that the company was prioritizing GMA over Live.\\n\\nRipa, executive\\xa0producer Michael Gelman and the show's staff learned about Strahan's exit after the show on Tuesday, a move that an ABC source admitted was\\xa0intended to control leaks and keep a handle on the narrative. Representatives for Ripa did not respond to requests for comment and the host, who is active on Twitter and Instagram, has been conspicuously silent on social media.\\n\\nLive's ratings performance has improved during Strahan's stint. The show is averaging nearly 4 million viewers this season with almost 1 million in the target daytime demographic of women 25-54. By contrast, Regis\\xa0Philbin's final season averaged 3.3 million viewers and 1.2 million women 25-54. Live is currently tied with perennial syndicated ratings leader Dr. Phil for the top slot among female viewers\\n\\nStrahan's arrival also was followed by growth among African American viewers and, by a greater margin, men. The diversified audience has helped the show grow its total viewership, while the piece of the pie occupied by women 25-54 has been on trend in its comparative stability.\\n\\nMeanwhile, GMA has declined double digits and\\xa0has seen NBC's Today show regain the lead this season among viewers 25-54. It's a critical benchmark since the morning shows generate the lion's share of revenue at the news divisions. Executives at ABC News have grappled with righting GMA without taking drastic measures. Ben Sherwood, now president of Disney- ABC Television Group,\\xa0has been a consistent advocate for Strahan.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWhen the show tapped him as a twice-weekly correspondent back in 2014,\\xa0ABC News executives made it clear that Strahan had an open invitation to appear more frequently on\\xa0GMA. And he recently pulled the trigger on that opportunity, said an ABC source, who noted that the deal for a full-time arrangement came together\\xa0fairly\\xa0quickly. Strahan, whose interview skills have improved since he joined\\xa0Live\\xa0in 2012, was looking for a broader platform, even if it comes with a 4 a.m. wake-up call.\\xa0\\n\\nA source close to Strahan says he intends to stay on at LIve\\xa0through the summer as previously planned while the show is supposed\\xa0to begin\\xa0auditioning new co-hosts for Ripa in September.

George\\'s schedule is very much his own, as it should be for a novelist. But we\\'re locked into a set schedule\\xa0—\\xa0a new season every year. In the beginning, we hoped that if the show worked, we\\'d get seven seasons to tell the tale. Seven kingdoms, seven gods, seven books\\xa0—\\xa0seven felt like a lucky number. The actual messiness of storytelling might not be quite that\\xa0numerologically\\xa0elegant, but we\\'re looking at somewhere between 70 and 75 hours before the credits roll for the last time.\\xa0\\n\\nThe show has diverged from the books quite dramatically by this point, but it\\'s still George\\'s world: The characters he\\'s dreamt up in the world he created. At this point, given the fact that we\\'re outpacing the novels, we all see the upside in the divergence: book readers won\\'t be spoiled by what\\'s to come on the show, and the show audience won\\'t have to worry about spoilers from the unpublished books. And we\\'re\\xa0very happy that the show has led so many people to discover George\\'s amazing books.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the beauties of\\xa0Thrones\\xa0is its subversive storytelling, where key characters fail and die if that\\'s what the reality of their situation dictates\\xa0—\\xa0the Ned and Robb Starks of the world. That said, for many, Jon Snow was viewed as the central hero fighting against the show\\'s most catastrophic threat. What does it mean for season six and the show at large that a character of such importance is off the board at this late stage of the game?\\n\\nCentral heroes don\\'t have any particular claim on immortality. In fact, we could argue that the notion of \"central heroes\" is one of the fantasy tropes that George\\'s books have so brilliantly exploded. Look, we all love\\xa0Lord of the Rings, but none of us really believed that\\xa0Sauron\\xa0was going to kill Frodo. Was any gambler dumb enough to bet money on\\xa0Voldemort\\xa0defeating Harry? In traditional fantasy, when the forces of darkness are arrayed against the armies of light, everyone knows who\\'s going to win. And that\\'s one of the elements that bored us about traditional fantasy: the predictability of it.\\xa0\\n\\nGame of Thrones\\xa0returns on April 24. What do you think about the show approaching the finish line?

R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire\\xa0novels, that April 24 result is only 0.6% less in viewers than what the then record breaking Season 5 GoT opener had on April 12 last year. Among the key demo, this year’s debut of the David Benioff and D.B Weiss EP’d show dipped 5% from the Season 5 premiere. Compared to June 14, 2015 fatality filled S5 finale, Sunday’s GoT was down 3% in the demo and 2% in overall viewers. The S5 finale was the all time viewership high for the battle for the Iron Throne.\\n\\nWhen the two repeats and streaming numbers are added in, the Season 6 debut of GoT had 10.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen. Those streaming numbers on HBO GO and HBO Now could also see some adjustments. Easily topping the night on cable, the return of GoT saw 9PM slot rival Fear The Walking Dead take a demo fall of 16% from the comparatively uncompetitive last week.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing GoT, HBO had the Season 3 debut of Silicon Valley and the Season 5 premiere of Veep. Both shows saw some falls from their results of last year with the former getting 1.86 million viewers and a 1.0 rating while the White House set latter had 1.10 million and a 0.5 rating. In viewership, the 10 PM Silicon Valley was down 13% and 23% in the demo.

The size of Prince\\'s fortune is unclear, though he made hundreds of millions of dollars for record companies, concert venues and others during his career and his estate included about $27 million in property.\\n\\nNelson asked that Bremer Trust, a corporate trust company, be named administrator of the estate. The court documents say Breber Bank provided financial services to Price for many years.\\n\\nThe filing comes less than a week after the pop star died Thursday at his home in suburban Minneapolis. The outpouring of grief and nostalgia prompted fans to buy 2.3 million of his songs in three days.\\n\\nPrince owned a dozen properties in and around his famous Paisley Park complex in suburban Minneapolis: mostly rural pieces of land and some houses for family members. Public records show those properties were worth about $27 million in 2016.\\n\\nEstimates of how much licensing his personal brand will bring in after death reach to the purple clouds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was as big as they get,\" said Mark Roesler, chief executive of CMG Worldwide, which handles licensing for the estates of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and other late stars.\\n\\nRoesler estimates Prince\\'s post-mortem earnings will match top-earning dead celebrities like Elvis Presley, whose estate made $55 million in 2015, according to Forbes magazine.\\n\\n\"Will there be a business built up around Prince 60 years from now like James Dean? The answer is unequivocally yes,\" said Roesler.\\n\\nIf Prince filed a will or created a trust, heirs to his future fortune would be known. But no such documents have yet turned up.\\n\\nUnder Minnesota law, a person can file a will with probate court in secret. If Prince did so, the fact one exists would become public once a death certificate is filed, but the medical examiner has not yet issued one for Prince. An autopsy was conducted Friday and his remains were cremated Saturday.\\n\\nL. Londell McMillan, a longtime lawyer and former manager of the superstar, declined to comment Monday to The Associated Press about whether the entertainer had a will or any other particulars regarding his estate, but added: \"I want to make sure his legacy is respected and protected no matter what role I play.\" McMillan was Michael Jackson\\'s lawyer and played a role in his estate, as well as those of rapper Notorious B.I.G. and Sammy Davis Jr.\\n\\nSeveral other attorneys who have done work for Prince in the past — including Alan Eidsness, who handled his 2006 divorce from Manuela Testolini Nelson — said they were not handling his estate.\\n\\nWealthy people usually create trusts to avoid the public spectacle of probate court, and it\\'s probable Prince did so, according to Irwin Feinberg, a Los Angeles trust and probate lawyer.\\n\\nPrince wasn\\'t married and had no known living children. Nelson is his only full-sibling, though he has five half-siblings (two other half-siblings have died) who could share in his estate if he has no will.\\n\\nThe AP did not find liens or mortgages on any of his properties, which range from a sprawling 160-acre piece of grassland between Lake Lucy and Lake Ann, to a three-bedroom bungalow in Minneapolis that is home to his half brother, Omarr Baker.\\n\\nPrince sold over 100 million albums on his lifetime, according to Warner Music Group. And Pollstar, a concert industry magazine, said that in the years that his tours topped the charts — 10 years over four decades performing — the tours raked in $225 million in ticket sales.\\n\\nHis best-earning touring year, when he took in $87.4 million, was 2004, the year he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and two decades after the soundtrack to Purple Rain\\xa0went multi-platinum.\\n\\nBut what remained in Prince\\'s hands is, by any estimate, less than the sum of ticket and album sales. In every record deal, a cut goes to the label, background performers and music publishers, though Prince published and wrote his own songs. Concert ticket revenue is split among the venue, the promoter, staff and the cost of travelling around. And prince was known to throw expensive parties.\\n\\nCourt battles in recent years suggest money wasn\\'t free flowing.\\n\\nIn April 2013, Prince lost a suit filed in New York State\\'s Supreme Court brought by perfume maker Revelations Perfume and Cosmetics Inc. for failing to promote the \"3121\" perfume line named after his album from 2006 and which he touted, but only once, in a massive concert that started July 7, 2007 near Macy\\'s in downtown Minneapolis and ended at 5 a.m. at the First Avenue club, a famous venue from \"Purple Rain.\"\\n\\nHe was ordered to pay $4.4 million; he never did. Instead, plaintiff lawyers went searching for assets, found about $3 million in various Minnesota bank accounts, and used court orders to freeze them, according to Brian Slipakoff, a New York lawyer who represented the perfume maker. Prince settled for a lower amount shortly after.\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t suggest there was oodles of cash lying around,\" Slipakoff said.\\n\\nPrince encountered tax difficulties several times over the years, including owing back taxes to France in 2012, which he paid up, and overdue property taxes around $450,000 in 2010. In 2013, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against him in Carver County, Minnesota, Court for $1.6 million. What happened with that case is unclear.\\n\\nRecords on file with Carver County, where Paisley Park is located, show that he was up to date on his property taxes when he died.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Ryan Reynolds’ follow-up film to his record-smashing superhero hit Deadpool is now before cameras.\\xa0Principal photography began today in London on Millennium Films’ action comedy The Hitman’s Bodyguard, which stars Reynolds, Samuel L.

At today’s made-for-TV, Cruz assured his fans he’d\\xa0spent much time assessing possible running mates, thinking through pros and cons, studying who these people are…praying about it,” etc. It’s his second Hail Mary pass of the past few days, coming on the heels of his “collusion,” as Trump calls it, with fellow candidate John Kasich in an effort to block the real-estate developer turned reality-tv star from getting to 1237 delegates in advance of the GOP convention.\\n\\nGuess how Trump’s son Eric summed up Cruz’s Fiorina announcement:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n', \"Will Ferrell to Play President Ronald Reagan in 'Reagan' Film\\n\\n\\n\\n        12:19 PM PDT 4/27/2016\\n    \\n                        by\\n                \\n                            Borys Kit\\n                    \\n\\n                    Borys Kit            \\n\\n\\n\\n        MIke Rosolio wrote the script, which appeared on last year's Black List.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill Ferrell is feeling presidential.\\n\\nThe comedic actor, who has already portrayed President George W.

The Magnificent Seven‘s Antoine Fuqua is directing. This is based on the final novel by The Godfather author Mario Puzo, and I wanted to get out in front of it because it’s coming together quickly. A pilot script and a bible is already in place by Justin Herber and Adam Hoff, and a writers room is quickly being assembled. A show runner and a female lead actress will be in place shortly. The networks will soon have their shot at it, with the expectation one will bite for a full series commitment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a disruptive move for Stallone after his Oscar nominated turn to reprise Rocky Balboa in the Ryan Coogler-directed Creed, but it also sounds like a strong next step for him by playing an outsized protagonist. It certainly worked out well for films actors like when Alec Baldwin moved to television in 30 Rock, and gave his career a whole new dimension.\\n\\nFuqua and Stallone will be exec producers along with Harvey and Bob Weinstein and David Glasser. TWC’s Megan Spanjian has been putting it all together. Harvey Weinstein bought Puzo’s final novel a decade ago to turn it into a movie. It languished after script after script couldn’t compress the storyline down to a feature. Turns out it was better suited for an event TV series.

The new $3 billion aggregate, which will take the TiVo name, is expected to generate “saving synergies” of $100 million in the first year, according to the announcement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The combined capabilities of TiVo and Rovi place us in a tremendous position to extend services across platforms and to a customer base that includes traditional, over-the-top and emerging players across the globe,” Rovi CEO Tom Carson, who will head the new company, said in the announcement. “By working together, Rovi and TiVo will revolutionize how consumers experience media and entertainment and at the same time build value for our stockholders.”\\n\\nSan Carlos, Calif.-based Rovi will pay $10.70 per share in cash and stock. “The new company combines two media and entertainment technology innovators with complementary products, services, and intellectual property assets and a common mission to write the next chapter of the consumer entertainment experience,” according to the announcement. Investors will get $2.75 per share in cash, or about $277 million. That’s a 40% premium over TiVo’s closing price of $7.66 on March 23, the day before reports of the imminent merger began appearing. The balance of the $7.95 per share will be paid in common stock shares of a new holding company combining Rovi and TiVo.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In joining forces with Rovi, our customers, employees and stockholders will benefit from being part of a more diversified industry leader with significantly greater market opportunities,” TiVo Interim CEO and CFO Naveen Chopra said in Friday’s announcement. “Our combination creates a more influential global player with a commitment to product innovation, which will be incredibly well positioned to redefine television.”\\n\\nShares of Rovi (ROVI) were up 3.7% to $17.99 in premarket trading. TiVo (TIVO) shares closed Thursday up 2% to $9.42. As reported earlier by Deadline, the DVR company has been struggling to find its place in the fast-changing video business. Its products have been too expensive for most viewers. Although they blend traditional cable or satellite video with Internet services such as Netflix, they can’t take advantage of two-way traditional pay TV services such as video on demand.\\n\\n“Rovi’s acquisition of TiVo, with its innovative products, talented team and substantial intellectual property portfolio, strengthens Rovi’s position as a global leader in media discovery, metadata, analytics, and IP licensing,” said Rovi CEO Tom Carson. “It’s an exciting time as the media and entertainment landscape undergoes a significant evolution. The combined capabilities of TiVo and Rovi place us in a tremendous position to extend services across platforms and to a customer base that includes traditional, over-the-top and emerging players across the globe.”\\n\\nHe added: “By working together, Rovi and TiVo will revolutionize how consumers experience media and entertainment and at the same time build value for our stockholders.”\\n\\nThe deal is expected to close in the third quarter, following shareholder approval and antitrust clearance.\\n', 'Posted on Friday, April 29th, 2016 by Angie Han\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHollywood is ready to roll the dice on another board game adaptation. A bidding war has broken out over Monsterpocalypse, a robots-versus-monsters game adaptation that has Fede Alvarez on board to direct. If the concept reminds you a bit of\\xa0Pacific Rim, you’re not the only one who’s noticed — an earlier version of the project stalled after Guillermo del Toro’s jaegers and kaiju stomped all over theaters in 2013. \\n\\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros., DreamWorks, and Sony are all fighting to acquire the Monsterpocalypse movie, and a fourth contender may also be on the way. A Monsterpocalypse movie was originally put into development around 2010 with Tim Burton directing and John August (Big Fish) writing, but was scrapped because it was too similar to Pacific Rim. The new version of the package is said to be radically different and less Pacific Rim-y, though it still pits humans against monsters.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition to directing, Alvarez will also write\\xa0Monsterpocalypse\\xa0with\\xa0Rodo Sayagues. The Uruguyan filmmaker\\xa0made his feature directing debut with 2013’s Evil Dead remake, after gaining attention for Panic Attack! and other short films. His sophomore effort, Don’t Breathe, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival this spring to strong reviews.\\n\\nHere’s how Privateer Press describes their\\xa0Monsterpocalypse board game:\\n\\nMonsterpocalypse is a fast-moving, action-packed strategy game played with high-quality pre-painted miniatures portraying the most fearsome giant monsters on Earth! Each battle takes place in a city that you and your opponent construct by placing buildings on a city map. Players choose their forces from their respective collections of figures and then battle one another with giant monsters and supporting units such as tanks, flying vehicles, and all manner of terrifying creatures. Charge your monster into the city to fight for supremacy, and be the last monster standing!\\n\\nIt’s a solid (if familiar) premise and an even better title. And since this doesn’t seem to be the kind of property that comes with a super complicated mythology,\\xa0it sounds like Alvarez will have more than enough room to make the project his own. The director definitely knows his way around large-scale destruction, as you can see in his\\xa0Panic Attack! short below:\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re gonna be calling a whole new team of Ghostbusters this summer, as Paul Feig‘s reboot has\\xa0Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones\\xa0strapping on those proton packs for the very first time.

From director Diego Echeverria\\xa0and\\xa0named for the nickname locals gave to the area, the film is a deep dive into the Southside of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, decades before the neighborhood became synonymous with New York City gentrification. Looking at the poverty, violent crime, crumbling infrastructure, drug abuse and other social issues affecting the area at the time, it is also a celebration of the neighborhood’s vibrant Puerto Rican and Dominican communities, and a look into how the members of those communities work to move past their challenges.\\n\\n\\n\\nLos Sures\\xa0was inspired by Living Los Sures, a project of UnionDocs Center for Documentary Art made over five years by 60 artists to give an expansive look into Williamsburg history and culture. Beginning with the restoration of Los Sures, the project has since resulted in a collection of 40 short films, the interactive documentary 89 Steps, and the cinematic people’s history Shot By Shot.\\n\\n“It is wonderful to see Los Sures join Oscilloscope’s catalog of incredible titles. Like us, they are literally based in the neighborhood that the film explores,” said UnionDocs’ Christopher Allen. “They understand the power of this film both as a tale of poverty in American cities and as a celebration of the community’s resilience.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough UnionDocs, the film opened theatrically exclusively at New York’s Metrograph theater on April 15, where it quickly earned $25,000 (and by its second week, $60,000). Oscilloscope will expand that release nationally, with showings and other distribution avenues to be announced soon.\\n\\n“We couldn’t be more excited to be joining forces with UnionDocs (who have done such an incredible job to this date), to help expand Los Sures’ footprint,” said Oscilloscope’s Dan Berger. “Diego’s film is a fascinating time capsule, expertly presented, and should appeal to audiences not just in New York, but everywhere.”\\n\\nEcheverria directed and produced Los Sures, which was shot by Mark Benjamin and Alicia Weber and edited by Kathryn Taverna.\\n', 'The story of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is headed to the screen… without\\xa0Kate del Castillo or Sean Penn.

Described as a story of power, money, sex and the human cost of the drug wars, the drama\\xa0will chronicle\\xa0the kingpin’s rise to power, taking\\xa0a look inside the stranger-than-fiction world of drug cartels who use social media to maintain their image, recruit new members and threaten rivals. Unlike drug lords of decades past, El Chapo, who reigned over the Mexican drug trafficking cartel for 25 years, has fan followings, with relationships in the entertainment and music industry that stretch past the Mexican border and into the United States.\\n\\n“The show is a metaphor for the lives we present on the internet, the secret selves we reveal in supposedly private communication, and the risks of not-so-humble-bragging on social media,” Brancato said.\\n\\n\\n\\nEl Chapo made big headlines\\xa0in the U.S. in January with a bizarre\\xa0story that emerged when\\xa0he\\xa0was captured\\xa0after\\xa0a six-month manhunt following his\\xa0daring escape from a Mexican prison.

That is going to change. With Jeff Bayer’s Remedial Film School a notable film critic or personality will assign me (and you) one film per month. Comedian Doug Benson from the podcast Doug Loves Movies is our guest, and he chose Used Cars (available for rent on iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon). Each section begins with a quote from the film.\\n\\nBenson explains: I don’t like recommending movies to people. I don’t like being told that I was wrong. About MY opinion. So now I say things like, “I like it, you might too.” Or, like in the case of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I say “I hated it, but you should check it out if you think you might like it.” So when the proprietor\\u200a—\\u200ais that the right word?\\u200a—\\u200aof this column asked me to pick a great film that he hasn’t seen, my very first thought was Used Cars. It’s a movie that is most certainly not everyone’s cup of proverbial tea, but man do I love it.\\n\\nThe star of Used Cars, Kurt Russell, is one of my favorite actors. I’ve been a fan back to his Disney days, when he was a tennis shoe wearing computer, or the subject of strength and invisibility experiments, but in his overall film career, I’d say he’s in only one truly great comedy. Before you come at me with the likes of Captain Ron or Overboard, I’d argue that dramas like The Hateful Eight and Bone Tomahawk were more amusing. What I love about Russell’s performance in Used Cars is that he accomplishes the nearly impossible feat of making a sleazy used car salesman likable. A used car salesman who wants to be a politician, even. How can this happen? Well, not only is Russell’s Rudy Russo a charmer, but the owner of the mega car lot across the street is a much bigger a-hole. As played by the late great Jack Warden, he’s a thoroughly over the top villain. That the same actor plays his sweet and low-key twin brother just adds to the fun.\\n\\nI should also mention that Used Cars is raunchy as hell. It’s dirtier than anything else from acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, but includes the complex plotting and fast pace of the Back To The Future films (I know, I know, Back to the Future II was TOO complex), the slapstick of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and the action of Flight and The Walk. It’s also got the manic energy of I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Spielberg’s 1941, both of which I enjoy but are not for everyone.\\n\\nUsed Cars\\u200a—\\u200aI like it, you might, too.\\n\\nBayer watches: I recognized two actor’s names in the opening credits (Russell and Warden). That’s it. Normally, with a film from 1980, I hope for more surprises. Thankfully, Used Cars delivers with a ton of familiar faces. If you don’t know these names, you know a performance… Al Lewis, Alfonso Arau, Frank McRae, Marc McClure, Michael Talbott, Joe Flaherty, Wendie Jo Sperber, David L. Lander, and Michael McKean. Those last guys are Lenny and Squiggy. Part of me wants to stop everything and figure out how these two decided to be in this movie, while also appearing together in Laverne & Shirley, and part of me realizes I’m dating myself for 80 percent of my audience. More important than that, this is Zemeckis. This is Spielberg (executive producer). Thanks to Rob Hunter’s Film School Rejects article “34 Things We Learned From The Used Cars Commentary” I just found out Spielberg brainstormed this plot, but wanted George Hamilton instead of Russell. This is hilarious because I can’t imagine anyone besides Russell pulling off this charm (plus, Hamilton?!?). Benson, you’re right. It shouldn’t be possible. A used car salesman/wannabe senator is not someone we consider caring about. I’d argue the script for Used Cars even agrees with that. But Russell had other plans. Case in point, as you mentioned Warden plays brothers. Well, the nice one dies from a heart attack. It’s something comedies used to do. They’d kill. 1974’s The Longest Yard did it as well. So let’s just decide N=2 and it happened all of the time. I was worried when I saw this scene coming, but two things made it worth while. Russell fully, truly commits to the scene. In fact, he’s the only one acting like he’s in an intense drama (for this scene), while everyone else is trying to find a laugh. Warden finds the perfect one. While fighting for life, he happily makes a sale. It’s truly brilliant. Not only that, I found that it was my moment of giving myself over to this comedy and having a really good time. If Warden doesn’t make the cash grab, I don’t accept this silly world. Instead, I’m in.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the movie is perfect. Benson, when you say the movie is “raunchy as hell,” I assume you mean, “It objectifies women like almost every other film, especially those in the ’80s that were rated R.” Women exist in this world to accidentally get naked, felt up, sexually assaulted, or rescued. Wait, there is one who is simply a nervous teenage driver. Women! It’s an indicator that Bob Gale and Zemeckis didn’t know how or didn’t care to write a quality female character. It’s obvious, but by no means is it a deal breaker for me with the film. It’s like your racist grandmother. Easy to spot, typical for the time, and impossible to change.\\n\\nEventually, a plot emerges. Oddly, it hinges on telling the truth (in a court room) that this used car lot technically has a mile of cars to sell. It feels weird, mainly because we never assume commercials are telling you the truth.\\n\\nThe problem with the film flow comes when Rudy and Barbara (Deborah Harmon) spend time developing a relationship. Once it starts, the fun comes to a screeching halt. There are many varieties of the line, “I got something I need to get off my chest,” but the truth never comes out. Laughs don’t seem like the top priority anymore. Since this world is fairly over-the-top and fictitious, you’re just left waiting. But don’t worry. Action is coming. The ending is truly enjoyable. There’s a huge caravan of cars (having to do with a mile of cars). With it comes some high-quality action featuring Russell and his stunt double. Benson, I like it.\\n\\nHere are a bunch of tiny moments and some questions for you to consider…\\n\\nHow many times have you seen this film? What was your first or most memorable viewing of the movie? Is the homemade pacemaker your favorite surprise in the film? It’s mine. The sidekick Jeff (Gerrit Graham) is great, which makes me slightly sad because while he’s a working actor, he didn’t become famous. Anyway, when he does his thing in the bar about luck, and spills salt, crawls under a ladder, and breaks a mirror, it feels like that could easily be borrowed into it’s own film. I love the concept of luck and the lengths that people are willing to go when they believe in it.\\n\\nJust recently, I’ve become addicted to film fridges thanks to the perfect one in Empire of the Sun. Rudy’s refrigerator contains a jar of pickles, Coors (heavy), a safe, and a ton of celery stalks. While Empire offers the best, this is now the weirdest (until someone proves me otherwise). Just to make sure we understand, it’s due to the insane amount of celery, not the safe.\\n\\nRussell disco dancing should be a gif. I wouldn’t use it, because technology frightens me, but seeing him fully commit to dancing, while thinking about his brilliant character John Ruth (from The Hateful Eight) is the history of an actor that I just love knowing.\\n\\nBecause I’m evil/awful/annoying you have to cast the remake. There is a figurative gun to your head. Who are in the main leads? The audition scene for Rudy would definitely be the fast-talking used car salesman scene that Russell nails in the beginning of the film. My only change, I want middle school kids to somehow have to drive all of the cars at the end of the film.\\n\\nFinally, I’d be remiss not to mention there is a title song at the end of the film. I want all movies, but specifically comedies, to be required by movie law to roll credits with a title theme song.\\n\\nMovie Score: 7/10\\n\\nBenson responds: Lenny and Squiggy also appeared together in 1941 (the movie, not the year). I think maybe Spielberg was high on George Hamilton around that time because Love At First Bite was a hit and Hamilton was pretty funny in it. Would’ve made Used Cars a much different, not to mention sleazier, experience with him in the role instead of Russell. And if Hamilton had done Used Cars we may have never gotten Zorro, The Gay Blade. Bayer, would you want to live in that world?\\n\\nI think The Longest Yard is more drama than comedy. The Burt Reynolds one, I mean. But bonus points to you, Bayer, for mentioning a prison movie while talking about Jack WARDEN.\\n\\nYeah, dude, women do not fare well in Used Cars. The film would get an F- on the Bechdel Test. But at least one could argue that the nudity is there specifically as exploitation. Sex sells, and the characters in the film figure out that boobs and bad words are an excellent way to get people to the lot.\\n\\nYou attribute the underwritten roles for women in this film to the youth of the writers, but has there ever been a fleshed-out and interesting part for a woman in a Zemeckis movie? Jessica Rabbit? Lea Thompson in Back To The Future? Oh, wait, I just remembered: Angelina Jolie in Beowulf! Anyway, creating great roles for the ladies has never been in his wheelhouse. But what he and Bob Gale were great at was twisty plots and exciting set pieces. The bad luck scene in Used Cars with the ladders and umbrellas is brilliant.I’ve probably seen Used Cars a couple dozen times, and have always been a little dismayed that it wasn’t a very popular film. I meet people all the time who love it, though, and a couple years ago I saw a screening of it in a packed theater that was laughing throughout. The biggest surprise in Used Cars for me, and part of the reason I think the movie holds up, is how vicious it gets, both in the killing of one Fuchs brother, and the fight between Rudy and the other Fuchs (wielding a chain) in the back of a pick-up truck. It’s like a Fast And Furious movie with jokes. Or intentional jokes, I should say.\\n\\nA remake of Used Cars, you say? I’m completely against it. But since there’s a gun pointed at me, I’d say Chris Pratt could do a pretty good job in the role of Rudy. In fact, the rest of the characters could be played by the cast of Parks And Recreation. Would love to see Nick Offerman in the dual role, Aziz Ansari could be the super superstitious guy, and Amy Poehler (or Aubrey Plaza) could add some comedic dimensions and personality to the female lead.\\n\\nAnd yes, Used Cars has a fantastic song at the end. Reminds me of “Eastbound and Down” from Smokey and the Bandit. Do movie themes get any better than that one?\\n\\nBayer concludes: Lenny and Squiggy\\xa0… That’s right. I forgot about 1941, which is definitely ready for me to watch again. It’s been years. I only remember liking, not loving, the film, and wondering why most considered it bad.\\n\\nZemeckis could point to Kathleen Turner in Romancing the Stone and Jodie Foster in Contact, but I think everyone would give the actresses credit over Zemeckis’ lead. You’re right. He, like almost all directors, isn’t great creating meaningful female characters.\\n\\nI’m a big fan of the Parks And Recreation crew reuniting for a film. Yes, it should definitely be this one. Offerman would clearly have a mustache for one brother. Perhaps Poehler can direct the film, if she wants to, and we’ll have Pratt and Plaza recreate some chemistry. Poehler and Rashida Jones can be Lenny and Squiggy. Adam Scott can play Joe Flaherty’s character. Nice job on the recasting Benson, and sorry I had to use an imaginary gun to get you to do it, but it had to be done.\\n\\nAlso, I forgot to mention, Jim’s (Frank McRae) punch through the windshield is amazing, and most importantly, necessary for the moment. It could be felt. This should be mimicked more. In fact, John Wick 2, if you’re listening, borrow it.\\n\\nFile this under, “Times Are Changing,” when Rudy has the promotion with the strippers. He is later shocked and bothered that someone actually got video of the thing. It made me realize we, and most definitely our children completely are without the concept of, “I did a public thing, but I assume no video was taken.” We truly are our own Big Brother, which is probably the most important lesson that Used Cars teaches us. That and Russell is brilliant at any age, and boobs sell. One final question, do I really have to watch Zorro, The Gay Blade?\\n\\nYour Next Assignment: Guest critic Sam Fragoso (host of Talk Easy, founder of Movie Mezzanine) selected Sweet Smell of Success.

Thanks to the Walt Disney Co.\\'s 2006 purchase of Pixar Animation Studios, for example, Hulett has seen versions of this movie before.\\n\\n\"Usually they spend a period of time trying to soothe nervous hearts,\" says Hulett of acquirers. \"They lie to the crew because they\\'ve got a picture to get out, and they can\\'t have people jumping ship. … They use whatever argument they can use to calm you down, [but] I suspect there will be 200 or 300 fewer people working there in the next 18 months.\"\\n\\nDWA is a union shop, and NBCU\\'s animation operation, Illumination Entertainment, isn\\'t. The guild has 565 members in feature animation at DWA and 281 in television. Hulett expects features to bear the brunt of the cuts while television will hold or grow.\\n\\nThe impact on Hollywood\\'s animators is one of several thorny issues that have yet to be addressed in the wake of NBCU\\'s April 28 reveal that it will pay $3.8 billion for Jeffrey Katzenberg\\'s animation house. NBCU CEO Steve Burke has been vague about the company\\'s plans for DWA, though the well-liked but thrifty Chris Meledandri, who runs Universal\\'s successful Illumination (Minions, Despicable Me), will be in charge. Jeff Shell, chairman of Universal\\'s film group, tells The Hollywood Reporter he admires DWA\\'s movie and television work, adding, \"Hopefully, we can find a way to do the same-quality films for a lower price.\" A studio insider says one engine for the deal — besides Shell\\'s admitted \"Disney envy\" and NBCU parent Comcast\\'s desire to stock its theme parks with fresh characters and other intellectual property — was the belief that DWA\\'s Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon are \"four franchises that aren\\'t over yet.\"\\n\\nHow those franchises will be exploited is not clear, but animators and executives say there are worlds of difference between the cultures of Illumination and DWA, which has been run since its inception by the highly charged and polarizing Katzenberg, 65. Adding to the intrigue, both he and Meledandri, 56, have been publicly silent, except for boilerplate statements, since the deal was announced. (It still must gain regulatory approval.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever happens, the landscape of Hollywood animation will change because for the first time in about 30 years, Katzenberg will not be a part of it. NBCU was willing to pay a premium for DWA in exchange for getting Katzenberg to give up his role and transition to running digital assets such as the DWA-backed AwesomenessTV. \"My guess is [NBCU] looked at Jeffrey as someone who was not capable of or not willing to cut productions aggressively,\" says Hulett. \"They figured Meledandri knows how to do it. He\\'s delivering billion-dollar movies on $80 million budgets.\" Hulett predicts NBCU will try to get DWA\\'s film budgets of $130 million or more down to less than $100 million. (Hulett and others note the true cost of these movies is difficult to discern from the outside.)\\n\\nIt is now part of Hollywood lore how Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, on arriving at Disney in 1984, were dismissive of animation and planning to outsource it cheaply overseas, only to be stopped by Roy Disney, Walt\\'s nephew. Tasked with it, Katzenberg\\xa0became enamored and launched a string of hits beginning with The Little Mermaid and culminating, before his dismissal from Disney in 1994, with the outsized success of The Lion King. Says Hulett, \"He really revived animated features as an art form to the way they were thought of under Disney in the \\'30s and \\'40s.\"\\n\\nWhen Katzenberg founded DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in 1994, \"there was a tremendous energy and drive to create a studio that would rival Disney,\" says Vicky Jenson, a director of Shrek and Shark Tale. In those days, DreamWorks animators traveled abroad to study the settings of the films. and experts were brought in to educate them about the world in which they were working. That practice, still in place at Pixar and its sister company Disney Animation Studios, began to fade as DWA hit rough waters and layoffs ensued. Katzenberg\\'s challenges were great after his division was spun off as a public company in 2004 to enable DreamWorks to repay investor Paul Allen: DWA now was answering to shareholders, with fortunes that seesawed depending on its releases.\\n\\nKatzenberg\\'s efforts to diversify DWA\\'s business led to distractions, and the quality of the films slipped. In recent years, \"one of the keywords presented to us was \\'marketability,\\' \" remembers Jenson. \"Business-wise, it probably made sense, but you could see the scary handwriting on the wall.\" She believes creative risk can be discouraged when marketers lead: \"If Pixar had done that, I don\\'t think we would have seen the movie Up.\"\\n\\nDisney\\'s handling of Pixar and Disney Animation, which were both placed under Pixar co-founders John Lasseter and Ed Catmull\\xa0after the 2006 purchase, clearly is the goal of NBCU\\'s\\xa0DWA purchase. Lasseter has managed to revive the fortunes of Disney Animation with such hits as Frozen and the recent Zootopia while maintaining the quality and bankability of Pixar films (despite the recent disappointment The Good Dinosaur). At the same time, Pixar has remained based in Northern California, operating with a distinct culture and a creative mandate separate from its Southern California sibling Disney Animation.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo that end, the physical and cultural differences between DWA and Illumination are especially stark. DWA has a lush 14.7-acre campus in Glendale (though it sold the property in 2015 to raise money, it has a long-term lease). \"All the outside patio furniture is redwood, top-quality stuff,\" says Tom Sito, a veteran of Disney and DWA who also has done work for Illumination and who now heads USC\\'s animation program. DWA serves its animators free lunches. By contrast, Illumination worked out of facilities that were rented as necessary until 2012, when the company set up shop in a small, 20,000-square-foot space in Santa Monica, largely populated with marketing staff. The company also has a significant but stripped-down production facility in a converted parking structure above an Alfa Romeo dealership in Paris. Whatever else may happen at DWA, says Jenson, \"They all know they\\'re going to be paying for lunch from now on.\"\\n\\nWhile Katzenberg still likes to work with comparatively large crews on his films, mostly under one roof, Sito says Illumination animators are far flung and work with directors through email and Skype, with Meledandri mostly managing from Santa Monica. \"There\\'s not a collection of artists in one room reacting to one another\\'s work,\" says Jenson. On the two Despicable Me films, Sito says, \"There would be story artists in New Hampshire and New Jersey and England and Canada. I\\'ve got to hand it to the directors [Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud] that they were able to pull it off.\" With Despicable Me 2 having pulled in more than $970 million worldwide in 2013, clearly it worked. Jenson says the look of the Illumination films is simpler, but audiences don\\'t seem to mind: \"[DWA\\'s]\\xa0Rise of the Guardians was a beautiful movie, but who could notice it if they didn\\'t go see it?\"\\n\\nOne key difference between the two companies has been that Illumination focuses more on story before major production spending begins, while DWA has been known to make costly changes while the film is in progress. Working with Katzenberg, says Jenson, \"I definitely got my share of horrible notes, the big \\'UGH\\' written on my pages, [but] he definitely understood what a good movie could be. At his best, he could help you find it.\" Adds Sito, \"Jeffrey rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because he\\'s so brusque. But he was passionate about the medium.\"\\n\\nAt this point, Hulett\\'s appraisal is less sentimental. \"The love of Jeffrey ended when the big layoffs came,\" he says. But he thinks Katzenberg, too, is feeling the pain. Despite a likely payday of $420 million from the sale, Hulett says: \"In some ways he\\'s licking his wounds. I think he really wanted to stay in the game.\"\\n\\nA version of this story first appeared in the May 13 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Seeking help from the local sheriff after receiving\\xa0severe harassment at the hands of Blackway (Ray Liotta), a former cop-turned-all-powerful local crime boss who runs the town with impunity, she’s advised to leave.\\n\\nInstead, she teams with the only two people left willing to stand up to Blackway: an ex-logger (Hopkins) and his laconic young friend (Alexander Ludwig).

Marvel also employed the facility to create a younger version of Michael Douglas in last summer\\'s Ant-Man.\\n\\nFor the scene in Civil War, the process started during production with Downey performing the scene. \"Instead of completely replacing the actor with a digital double, this method allowed us to retain the actor\\'s performance and nuances,\" Trent Claus, visual effects supervisor at Lola VFX, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"Then we began to adjust the on-set footage of Tony Stark through digital compositing.\"\\n\\nThat process is akin to using Photoshop on a still image. Says Claus: \"It is a similar process to Photoshop that uses some similar tools, but unlike Photoshop which is done on a single image, we have 24 frames per second of footage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Every feature of the face and body needed to be addressed in some fashion,\" he says of the work that went into creating the youthful Tony.\\xa0\"One thing that happens to all of us is that the skin of the face gradually lowers in certain areas, and needs to be \\'lifted\\' back to where it was at the age in question. But other changes are incredibly subtle, such as increase in the way light reflects off the sheen of the skin, a reduction in the appearance of tiny blood vessels under the surface of some parts of the face, or more blood flow in the cheeks giving them that familiar youthful \\'glow.\\' \"\\n\\nDe-aging a character by a span of 25-30 years can affect skin texture and complexion and can involve characteristics such as bone structure or posture, Claus explains. \"Additionally, when working with the appearance of a well-known actor such as Robert Downey Jr., there is the added pressure of living up to the youthful appearance that audiences remember,\" he says. \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less Than Zero [when Downey was in his early 20s].\"\\n\\nThe particular shot was also challenging because of its length and because it involved a close-up. Says Claus:\\xa0\"The shot was nearly 4,000 frames long, with Tony Stark turning from one side to the other multiple times, physically interacting with other actors, and the set itself, and moving closer to the camera for a very long, uninterrupted close-up.\"\\n\\nClaus and other VFX pros are increasingly being asked to employ such digital tricks.\\xa0\"Creatives are finding more and more uses for it. It allow actors to play earlier versions of themselves,\" says Eric Barba, who was at Digital Domain when he served as the Oscar-winning VFX supervisor of Benjamin Button\\xa0and who currently works at Industrial Light & Magic in Vancouver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut such digital work isn\\'t being used only to allow an actor to play a character decades young than himself. There\\'s also what\\'s called \"beauty\" work — in effect, providing actors with digital facelifts — a practice\\xa0many in Hollywood would prefer to keep secret. \"The not-so-obvious examples are probably under confidentiality,\" says\\xa0Barba. \"There are certain\\xa0stars that you are not allowed to talk about when that type of work is done — maybe slimming a little bit or cleaning up some imperfections.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s much more common than anyone realizes; this is the extension of what\\'s done for magazine covers,\" says research professor Paul Debevec,\\xa0who leads the Graphics Lab at the University of Southern California\\'s Institute for Creative Technologies.\\n\\nAs digital technology has become more affordable, \"if it\\'s a major actor, you can do that for every frame of a film,\" adds\\xa0Debevec, who also co-chairs the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\\' SciTech Council. \"Of course one of the worries is that actors are going to have this Dorian Gray problem because the image that we have of them in the films is going to diverge further and further from the way that they look in real life. So they are going to have more trouble on the talk shows and on the red carpet, until those too can be touched up in real time with a yet-to-be invented technology.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s not just about freshening up a face either. VFX techniques\\xa0can also be used to create everything up to a full digital double of an actor. Those tend to be created for safety reasons, where a stunt would be either dangerous or simply impossible; or in the delicate situation of the death of an actor.\\xa0Weta Digital undertook the task of completing Paul Walker\\'s performance in 2015\\'s Furious 7 after his unexpected death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a whole other level of complexity,\" Debevec explains. \"It\\'s not a matter of digital makeup but actually re-creating a digital version of the person that is three-dimensional, animate-able and relight-able. [In these instances], if you can base it on facial scans, that\\'s the best thing to do.\"\\n\\nUSC\\'s ICT has developed a light-stage system (a sphere of hundreds of LED lights that\\'s used to create a high-res, 3D scan) that has already been used to scan actors for films from Avatar to Gravity\\xa0— Downey himself underwent such a scan when it looked as if he would be starring in Gravity.\\xa0\"We first scanned him for Gravity\\xa0[before George Clooney was recast as Matt Kowalski], and the scan ended up getting used in Iron Man movies instead,\" says\\xa0Debevec.\\n\\nILM is using a facial-capture system called Medusa, which was developed by Disney Research in Zurich. \"We have been putting it to use in production and helping them advance it,\" says\\xa0Barba.\\n\\nSome productions now create 3D scans of lead actors as a matter of course.

His latest feature, I, Daniel Blake, is quintessential Loach, which means you have a good idea of what you\\'re getting as soon as the core elements are established. And yet while the framework and perspective are familiar, the veteran Brit director\\'s films can still have the power to grip us in an emotional chokehold.\\n\\nThat\\'s very much the case in Loach\\'s latest Cannes competition entry, despite a script by his longtime collaborator Paul Laverty that at times wades into didactic pandering, hammering home in dialogue points about a callous State that are already embedded in the story. The tendency to pile indignation upon indignation almost risks nudging the drama onto a righteous soapbox.\\n\\nBut despite those flaws, the film is anchored by incisive characterizations rich in integrity and heart, and by an urgent simplicity in its storytelling that\\'s surprisingly powerful. This is reflected also in cinematographer Robbie Ryan\\'s crisp, unfussy presentation of the Newcastle upon Tyne setting. Eschewing handwringing, I, Daniel Blake portrays ordinary people pushed to breaking point by circumstances beyond their control, and by a government welfare system of circuitous Kafkaesque bureaucracy seemingly designed to beat them down.\\n\\nAt the center is the Geordie of the title, Daniel Blake, played by comedian Dave Johns in a performance all the more moving for its restraint, and for the dogged determination etched deeper into his face with each fresh frustration. A skilled carpenter in his late fifties, Daniel lives alone in a Brutalist low-cost housing block, keeping up a scrappy but good-natured rapport with his neighbors. He has managed to remain gainfully employed even while nursing his wife through a long illness that ultimately killed her. But doctors have forbidden him from returning to work until he has sufficiently recovered from a heart attack.\\n\\nThe beginning of his odyssey is amusingly played out in offscreen dialogue heard over the opening titles, as a health officer interviews Daniel about his eligibility for Employment and Support Allowance. His impatience grows as he fields a string of inane questions about basic motor skills and continence, none of them having anything to do with the condition of his heart. When the assessor judges him fit for work, his travails begin, first on a telephone helpline with epic hold time, and then at the local job center, where getting someone actually to listen while he explains his situation proves impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\nLoach and Laverty make the argument that the arcane complexities of the welfare system — with its head-spinning protocols, appeals, sanctions and built-in stumbling blocks — are a political weapon designed to save the government money. While that institutional hostility is represented here by the cold indifference of employment office workers, it\\'s clear that the filmmakers are taking issue with the kind of unfounded generalizations common to conservative pundits, who accuse people on welfare of being lazy \"skivers\" that don\\'t want to work.\\n\\nThe one sympathetic ear at the job center belongs to a woman named Ann (Kate Rutter), who is reprimanded by her supervisor for taking the time to walk befuddled Daniel through a confusing online form. She warns him that not following the rules can have dire consequences, and that many honest, hardworking people like him have found themselves on the street after being defeated by the system. The story essentially boils down to Daniel\\'s quest to hang in there and play the game long enough to secure an appeal interview — all while continuing to live without an income.\\n\\nHe hits frequent brick walls, but Daniel also experiences many small acts of kindness from people in a vividly drawn milieu that Loach clearly knows well. And Daniel in turn shows overwhelming kindness to Katie (Hayley Squires), a young single mother with two children, relocated from London after being evicted by her affordable-housing landlord for filing a legitimate complaint, and then spending two years in a homeless hostel. Beaten by her own clashes with the job center, Katie goes without food and basic necessities to take care of her kids, eventually pushing her to make heartbreaking choices.\\n\\nAnyone who has ever witnessed an elderly parent or relative struggle with automated customer support lines or basic computer functions will find it distressing to watch Daniel\\'s exasperation. The film provides cogent evidence that we no longer live in a society designed to listen to people\\'s problems, and many are simply unable to navigate the modern world unassisted.\\n\\nThe basic human rights at stake here are tremendously relatable, even to those of us who have never come close to this degree of deprivation. One of the more upsetting scenes shows Katie\\'s visit to a food bank, where her near-starvation causes an incident that alarms her children and Daniel, who has grown close to the family. Like Johns, who embraces the story\\'s farcical elements while never obscuring its sorrow, Squires strikes no false notes in her beautifully subdued performance. If the script veers into cliché by backing Katie into the most compromising corner of hopelessness, the character never seems less than authentic.\\n\\nIt\\'s too easy to be cynical about Loach\\'s films, and his inclusion in the Cannes lineup often prompts eye rolls about good old stalwart leftie Ken, back with another noble anti-conservative tract. But the consistency of his career and the clarity of his message command admiration. This film contains echoes of any number of previous entries from the director\\'s extensive output, stretching back to Cathy Come Home, the searing 1966 BBC TV play about homelessness. But it also feels entirely of the moment in a time of increasing attention to income inequality as the divide between the haves and have-nots becomes a dangerous chasm.\\n\\nVenue: Cannes Film Festival (Competition)\\n\\tCast: Dave Johns, Hayley Squires, Dylan McKiernan, Briana Shann, Kate Rutter, Sharon Percy, Kema Sikazwe\\n\\tProduction companies: Sixteen Films, Why Not Productions, Wild Bunch, Les Films du Fleuve, Le Pacte\\n\\tDirector: Ken Loach\\n\\tScreenwriter: Paul Laverty\\n\\tProducer: Rebecca O’Brien\\n\\tExecutive producers: Pascal Caucheteux, Gregoire Sorlat, Vincent Maraval\\n\\tDirector of photography: Robbie Ryan\\n\\tProduction designers: Fergus Clegg, Linda Wilson\\n\\tCostume designer: Joanne Slater\\n\\tMusic: George Fenton\\n\\tEditor: Jonathan Morris\\n\\tCasting: Kahleen Crawford\\n\\tSales: Wild Bunch\\n\\tNo rating, 100 minutes.\\n', 'Inside the Fight to Save Southeast Asia\\'s Historic Movie Theaters\\n\\n\\n\\n        10:25 PM PDT 5/11/2016\\n    \\n                        by\\n                \\n                            Patrick Brzeski\\n                    \\n\\n                    Patrick Brzeski            \\n\\n\\n\\n        Myanmar\\'s U.S. ambassador believes cinemas \"are symbols of free speech, creativity and self-expression from a bygone era.\"\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNestled down a sleepy street in the historic Rattanakosin district of Bangkok, Thailand, the Nang Loeng Cinema was built in 1918 by the Siam Cinema Co. The theater closed its doors in 1993Â\\x8d, around the time that shopping malls and modern multiplexes were popping up across Thailand, driving the country’s quaint single-screen neighborhood cinemas out of business. The Â\\x82Â\\x83Â\\x83400-seat antique movie house is made entirely of Thai teak, except for its original galvanized iron roof. For years, the Nang Loeng Cinema was used as a warehouse for a nearby open-air market.\\n\\nNow, a group of conservationists, film lovers and the Property Bureau of the Thai monarchy have come together to revive the theater, which organizers hope will be back in service by 2018, in time to celebrate the structure’s centenary. The conservation effort was kick-started by Philip Jablon, an American photographer and sustainable development researcher who has been chronicling the state of Southeast Asia’s heritage cinemas for the last six years via an undertaking he calls the Southeast Asia Movie Theater Project. With modest financial support from the Thai Film Archive, Jablon has been traveling across Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, photographing and cataloging an estimated 300 cinemas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Old movie theaters tend to be the first thing to go during development,” says Jablon, “because they have a large footprint and usually occupy prime real estate.” The same forces of economic development that are raising living standards and making Southeast Asia a bright spot on the global movie distribution map also carry a bitter irony for the region’s cinematic heritage. Jablon says he has returned to many towns and cities in Myanmar and Thailand to find beautiful midcentury movie theaters already replaced by box stores or shopping centers.\\n\\nJablon’s goal was to create an archive of the region’s cinematic architecture before it disappeared. “But the hope was always that the project could help foster some conservation efforts,” he adds. His belief is that once the boom era subsides, Southeast Asian cities will go through the same process of urban rediscovery Western cities have, turning away from suburban sprawl to revive heritage architecture in city centers.\\n\\nTo his delight, the past year has brought positive momentum. “There’s been a sea change in the way people are looking at architectural preservation in Thailand,” says Jablon. Along with Nang Loeng Cinema, the Prince Cinema in one of Bangkok’s riverside districts has been targeted for revival by a city government project. Built in the ’30s, the theater has fallen into disrepair and operated as a porn theater in its final years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJablon made his most recent photo mission to Myanmar, photographing dozens of theaters in the country’s southern regions. Nowhere in Southeast Asia is changing quite as fast as Myanmar, where the military government began instituting democratic reform and opening the country to international investment in 2011. Many of the cinemas Jablon had heard about already were gone, but his trip ended on an optimistic note. After an exhibition of his photography at a local art gallery, a panel discussion was held on the topic of conserving and restoring Yangon’s Waziya Cinema, a Beaux Arts movie palace that dates back to the late 20s.\\xa0Jablon reached out to an influential local conservation group called the Yangon Heritage Trust, as well as the U.S. Embassy to Myanmar, which both have thrown their weight behind the conservation effort.\\n\\nAdds Derek Mitchell, the U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, in a statement: “Waziya Cinema stands as one of the few remaining symbols of free speech, creativity and self-expression from a bygone era when film informed and enriched people’s lives here with stories from Burma and around the world.”\\n\\n\\n', '50 Shades of Grey star Dakota Johnson is joining Andrew Garfield in David Robert Mitchell’s Under The Silver Lake,\\xa0a modern noir crime thriller set in Los Angeles that is written and to be directed by David Robert Mitchell.

Maren Ade\\'s \"Toni Erdmann\"\\n\\nThe German director’s long-anticipated third film is a triumph of observational storytelling.\\n\\nYesterday, many of our hopes were realized at the Cannes Film Festival. German director Maren Ade, whose second film Everyone Else still feels like the secret discovery of 2008, has finally returned with a new film—and it is not only great, it\\'s a also quite a surprise. Devoted with extreme sensitivity and patience to the stilted relationship between a professional young woman, Sandra Hüller\\'s uptight, defensive Ines, and her sad sack, prankster father Winfried (Peter Simonischek), Toni Erdmann spends its considerable runtime observing how these two, by themselves and together, put up emotional shields to navigate unhappy lives.\\n\\nOn paper perhaps something of a cliché, with Ines’ repressed chill keeping her career successful, if just barely, but emotionally unsatisfied working a corporate consultancy job in Bucharest, and a father whose sudden appearance at her work is an awkward embarrassment. Yet this immensely talented director brings to each and every social interaction an observant, unmannered, and utterly spot-on evocation of what each person is thinking and feeling. This masterly ability to observe and reveal without overly directing our attention to what the father and daughter are going through extends just as beautifully to well-detailed secondary roles like that of Ines\\' arrogant boss, her frightened-eyed assistant, and an American girlfriend also living in the Romanian capital—a deft handling that goes all the way down to passing characters spied once and never again. Maren Ade proves herself a modest master of observation, letting us find on our own, casually and never didactically, how everyone in a scene is responding to each other and the circumstance.\\n\\nToni Erdmann’s precision of observation may make it sound like a normal drama done well, but in fact Ade keeps us on our toes throughout its near-3 hours run time. The film rides an at first unnoticeable but gradually increasingly apparent and difficult line of storytelling, courting our expectations of how a father-daughter story like this will go—with her embarrassment over her father’s antics and unprofessionalism coupled with his sweetly clueless, silent pleas for affection—but at every turn upending convention. Except, Ade does nothing radical, nothing unusual as her story moves, it simply moves freely, each development not quite how one would think it could go, yet never extreme enough to move into melodrama or some other extreme that would leave the film’s calm, considerate humaneness behind.\\n\\nIts attention, through and through, are to the nuances of a deeply unresolved relationship, one which a father’s impromptu sudden visit will hardly instantly fix. But the man is persistent and dogged, playing constantly with fake teeth and sarcastic humor with a barely hidden grin. He kindly tries, without much self-awareness, to ingratiate himself in situations, whether at a corporate party or in the strained, everyday conversations with his daughter, in which he is uncomfortable and doesn\\'t fit in—which are most situations. He leaves, he returns, she sends him away, and he comes back, always with the sheepish, smiling look on his face. The film is, gratefully and painfully, very funny and very sad.\\n\\nWinfried is trying and we like him for this, but we also don\\'t know the full history of his uncomfortable relationship with his daughter—we simply feel it, deeply, just as we do Ines\\' depression and self-denial. Midway through, faced again with his daughter’s rejection, Winfried makes one of his goofy gestures of ill-placed humor, hilariously popping up at a bar behind his daughter in a ridiculous wig, the bad teeth, and an unkempt power suit and claims to be\\xa0“Toni Erdmann,” a life coach visiting Bucharest. Even worse, this character starts showing up at his daughter’s social engagements and work—work, incidentally, that Ade treats with remarkable detail and realism, as we learn just what exactly Ines has to do and what she has to put up with at her awful consultancy job.\\n\\nIn another film, Winfried\\'s almost farcical costume would transform the story into something else, as his daughter learns what lengths he’ll go to be with her. But no—it’s just another, more elaborate joke that’s trying to win a smile on her face, with no greater ambitions. To close her story, Ade admittedly have to bring things to a head, a birthday party the daughter pathetically throws for herself which doesn’t turn out a she plans, yet as always with the film, the way the situation shifts, catches us off guard, ending somewhere far different than where it began. The party, a constantly evolving situation of great humor and insight, does precisely what Maren Ade throughout does best and what makes Toni Erdmann great: never grasping for epiphanies but instead building over time, with warm patience and true perception, an incredibly rich portrait of people and their all-too-delicate relationships.\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not often that I get invited down to Industrial Light & Magic in San Francisco, CA, but when the invite is thrown my way it’s usually to see something cool. Earlier this month I traveled up north to see how filmmaker Duncan Jones used ILM to create the orcs in his big screen adaptation Warcraft, based on the popular Blizzard video game series.\\n\\nI’ll be completely honest with you: the marketing for this movie had done little to convince me that it was a film I wanted to see. I’m not a video gamer and have never played World of Warcraft, and to be completely honest, I’m not a big fantasy (orcs, wizards, dungeons and dragons) type of guy. But I’m a big fan of Duncan Jones and that alone had me continuously searching for reasons.\\n\\nSo I hopped on a plane and visited the visual effects house that George Lucas built, hoping I would\\xa0be wowed.\\xa0The filmmakers behind the movie pulled the curtain back to show us how the magic was created, and that in itself was not only very interesting but very impressive. So hit the jump and learn why ILM considers the Warcraft facial capture advancements to be groundbreaking.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Huge Challenge of Creating Realistic-Looking Orcs\\n\\nDuncan Jones knew that when he came on to Warcraft that the biggest challenge would be creating the orcs themselves. He explained to me that they needed to have characters that not only could win the audience’s empathy, but\\xa0could “hold a close-up.”\\n\\nA lot of the design choices in the video game were made over twenty years ago. ILM realized they needed to adapt the more cartoony look of the designs to fit the mandate of presenting what those characters and species would look like if they were real. Wei Wang, a Blizzard concept artist, gave them an initial sketch which became the blueprint on how the orcs should look. And you could easily mistake this initial sketch as art inspired by the movie\\xa0—\\xa0it looks that close to what we see in the film.\\n\\nIn the world of Warcraft, orcs have the same size heads as humans but are much wider and stand 6 and a half to 7 feet tall. The artists\\xa0decided that practical make-up wouldn’t work for what they needed, so they instead decided to go all in on a performance and facial capture approach.\\n\\nBy creating the orcs using performance capture, they didn’t have to worry about how big, tall, or muscular the actors were, instead focusing purely on performance. The orcs’ movements were developed by Terry Notary, who of course also\\xa0worked on the Lord of the Rings films and the Apes films. Terry Notary played a lot of the “background” characters in the film, as well as some of the hero characters, notably Grommash Hellscream.\\n\\n \\n\\nILM’s “Groundbreaking” Facial Capture Work on Warcraft\\n\\nILM had been working on their facial capture technology for a while now and felt they were finally making impressive headway with the work they did on the Hulk in The Avengers. ILM completed some tests to help convince Jones that the technology was at the stage it needed to be to accomplish his vision for Warcraft, but it wasn’t until he got back the first completed shot that he was convinced that his bet would pay off. That first shot is one of the most impressive shots in the entire movie, and you’ll see it very early in the film. It’s not a big impressive battle, but a very emotional scene between an orc and his pregnant wife in their hut.\\n\\nThe emotion that comes from the faces of these computer generated creatures is astounding and it’s no surprise that ILM considers their facial capture work on this film to be “groundbreaking.” We’re seen some impressive facial capture work from WETA, especially on the recent Apes films, and while Andy Serkis has been fighting the battle of what he calls “digital make-up,” performances still require animators to rework and manipulate the data captured on set. But this film supposedly features a closer to one-to-one ratio of performance to rendering.\\n\\nWe were shown a very impressive video showing a side-by-side comparison of the human motion capture performances and the final renders, and I know we’ve seen this sort of thing before on Avatar and the Apes films, but this was even more impressive — it’s amazing how much of the facial movements of the human actors made it to the CG versions of the orcs. You can see a short snippet of some of the footage I screened in this new featurette:\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nThe facial motion capture was not approached as something expendable or something to be used as merely reference, but as\\xa0performances that needed to be captured for the final product. ILM is particularly proud that very little modification was taken to create the completed facial performances in the film. The facial capture was accomplished with two cameras on the face of each hero orc actor, with over 200 motion dots on the face which needed to be tracked. People, assisted with some software tools, have to individually guide the tracking of every dot. They also did a rigid track on the eyeballs and teeth, allowing them to separate out the jaw motion from the skin/head.\\n\\nOnce they had all this data, the ILM animators would reproduce the performance on a 3D scan of the actor to make sure it looked right before they even began to transfer the performances to the model of their orc counterpart.\\n', 'TNT has given a pilot order to Civil, a political and social drama that sounds ominously close to real-life current events.\\n\\n\\n\\nWritten and executive produced by A Simple Plan scribe Scott Smith and directed by\\xa0Allen Coulter (Ray Donovan), Civil takes place in the wake of a hotly contested Presidential election, as America finds itself plunging uncontrollably into a modern day Civil War.

So in other words, if Arnold [Schwarzenegger]’s in it – which I’m not allowed to discuss [laughs] – he would be old Arnold.\\n\\nSo there you go. Black has answered a question that no one was asking because of course Schwarzenegger would be his modern self if he appeared in the movie. It’s a couple of decades later. Anyway, Black also explained that the title actually has some significance beyond the desire to not put a number in it:\\n\\nThere is a reference in the script as to why that makes sense, but I’m not really supposed to talk about it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Finding Dory director Andrew Stanton recently fielded some questions on Twitter and naturally, someone asked him about whether or not this film will definitively close the book on the series or if there are any plans at all to continue it in the future. His response is a fine example of hedging one’s bets: https://twitter.com/andrewstanton/status/732356385682259968 But how about a John Carter sequel? Seriously. John Carter is pretty terrific and Andrew Stanton should be let out of live-action director’s jail for that one. His response to this query is, well, it’s interesting: https://twitter.com/andrewstanton/status/732356578347622400 What kind of special event could he be referring to here? In any case, it’s a shame that he’s not involved because that movie deserved so much more (including a follow-up or\\xa0two). Meanwhile, a new batch of Finding Dory posters have arrived and you can check them out in the gallery below.\\n\\nWhile we’re talking about Pixar directors, a Reddit user has noticed a tiny Easter egg in Monsters University that calls back to Monsters Inc., a fun reminder that these folks think about everything.  We’ve already seen the announcement trailer for the woefully titled T2: Trainspotting, but now we know a release date. Danny Boyle’s sequel will open in the U.K. on January 27, 2017 before opening in limited release in the United States on February 3, 2017. It will then expand wide on February 10.\\n', 'The Forgotten: Allan Dwan\\'s \"Black Sheep\" (1935)\\n\\nA professional gambler and an actress team up to rescue a straying youth on an ocean liner in Allan Dwan’s crime comedy Black Sheep.\\n\\nRelatively few films from Fox Pictures (before they became Twentieth Century Fox) are readily available: Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is the big one. The modest caper Black Sheep wouldn\\'t be high on the list for reissue: stars Edmund Lowe and Claire Trevor aren\\'t too well-remembered, though he\\'s in Dinner at Eight and she\\'s in Stagecoach. Despite a large cast of supporting players, rotund character man Eugene Pallette is the only other really familiar figure, though founding Keystone Kop Ford Sterling has a good bit as a ship\\'s detective.\\n\\nWe\\'re on a transatlantic liner, see, and there are warnings posted about professional gamblers: The Lady Eve territory, before Sturges thought of it. Lowe is such a gambler, but he\\'s a swell guy really. Trevor plays an actress, which is no stretch, and the two have real chemistry. He has a debonair manner and a mellifluous voice—and a drunk scene, as usual. Trevor could play hard and brassy later, but here she\\'s pure vanilla ice cream, smooth and cool and sweet. Her reaction shots are priceless too, punctuating the witty banter.\\n\\nImmortal journeyman Allan Dwan also wrote the story, and has fun gliding his camera around the deck to the tunes provided by aspiring genius/madman Oscar Levant. We\\'re in that popular thirties staple, the drama where the supporting players almost overwhelm the main storyline, but everything somehow maintains balance—the form climaxed with Casablanca, I think.\\n\\nLowe and Trevor decide to help out a young chap (Tom Brown) who\\'s being fleeced by card sharps Pallette and Jed Prouty, and also blackmailed by a kleptomaniac adventuress (Adrienne Ames, very sleek). The plot takes a turn when Lowe realizes that Brown is his long-estranged son, who doesn\\'t know him. What we have here is a gender-inversion of an old melodramatic staple: a male Madame X.\\n\\nDwan is one of these guys almost genetically engineered to defeat auteurism, having made swashbucklers, war pics, romances and farces across his unbelievably long and busy career. No theme or obsession or particular world-view unifies his oeuvre: I think his defining trait is just a love of yarn-spinning.\\n\\nBeing as this is 1935, pre-Code sin is out of the question, but all the characters are a little shady and the script\\'s prevarications about just how crooked they might all be don\\'t get in the way of enjoying a spot of blackmail, burglary, gambling, drunkenness and raucous practical joking from Huge Euge (Pallette never seemed more repulsive: frequently the movies allowed him a soft center, but here his loud obnoxiousness is much to the fore, barely disguised by a tissue-thin veneer of southern courtliness).\\n\\nLowe and Trevor are so delightful together you long for a whole season of Thin Man type romps for them to connive through. Sometimes film history just misses a trick.\\n', '\\n\\t        \\tThe Taiwanese-American stars in past and recent films. \\n\\n\\nLast week the hashtag #StarringJohnCho trended on Twitter as a way to highlight the lack of Asian actors in leading roles.

If you haven’t seen the Byron Balasco-created show starring Frank Grillo, Jonathan Tucker, Nick Jonas, Natalie Martinez, Joanna Going, Matt Lauria and Kiele Sanchez, then I strongly suggest you tune in.\\n\\n\\n\\nI suggest that because Kingdom returns hard and relentless, not just in the fights of this fightin’ world but where it really matters: in the drama and the characters.\\n\\nSet among the gyms, boardwalks and back alleys of Venice, CA with a lot of sex, drugs and cage matches, Kingdom follows the fights, victories and failures of ex-MMA fighter-turned-Navy St. gym owner Alvey Kulina (played by Marvel Universe and The Purge alum Grillo) and his loved ones. It’s a sometimes harsh, often painful and almost always intense world that is addictively watchable in these new 10-episodes and very bingeable. As I say in my video review above, I was late to the game on Kingdom, which first debuted in October 2014, but that’s OK in one sense because Kingdom 2B is a series truly flexing new muscles.\\n\\n\\n\\nFighting with himself and his loyalties more than ever, Grillo is great. As is Going as Alvey’s estranged wife Christina and Sanchez as Lisa Prince, Alvey’s current but also now-estranged lady who was running Navy St. until recently. More than pulling his weight is Jonas as Alvey and Christina’s youngest son Nate, a fighter with great potential and ambitions but weighed down by personal struggles.\\n\\nHowever, with the lightweight battles between ex-con and now championship-defending Ryan (the fantastic Lauria) and Jay (Tucker) propelling the episodes thematically, the belt here belongs to the\\xa0ex-Parenthood\\xa0actor. As the oldest Kulina son, Tucker goes deeper, harder and darker with the character than we’ve seen in the past as Jay seeks both victory and acceptance. The other standouts for me in a muscular cast were Under The Dome alum Martinez as female fighter Alicia Mendez, who battles on many levels in this testosterone-drenched arena, and Lina Esco joining as Alicia’s sister Ava, throwing all new spanners in the already fragile works of Navy St.\\n\\nLook, you don’t have to be a fight fan to like Kingdom, but if you are a fan of driven ragged heart and soul, then you need to watch this show. And now that AT&T owns DirecTV, you can also stream Kingdom on U-verse too.\\n\\nSo click on my review above and tell us what you think.\\n\\n\\nRelatedAntonio Banderas To Star In ‘Salty’; Frank Grillo Is ‘Wheelman’ – Cannes Briefs\\n\\n', 'EXCLUSIVE:\\xa0Frank Spotnitz has exited The Man In The High Castle.

But the first was Stohrer, which opened in 1730 by pastry chef Nicolas Stohrer, the pastry chef for\\xa0Louis XV\\xa0of France and his wife, the daughter of the king of Poland. I can only imagine what the shop looked like back then, but I’m sure it was quite a different place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday the rue Montorgueil is a thriving, busy pedestrian street, with the occasional motor scooter racing down it, beeping its way through the crowds of shoppers. The street has changed a lot in the last decade or so, since I first walked down it. During the day, there are open air shops selling produce, several excellent cheese shops, a crier (a fish market when the young men in rubber boots call out what fish they are trying to sell that day), bread bakeries, and cafés whose rickety seats spill out onto the\\xa0streets, which\\xa0are occupied with early risers getting in their first cup of coffee, to a crowd of hipsters and other locals, drinking beers until late in the evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor me, it’s not a visit to rue Montorgueil without checking out the always-spectacular windows at Stohrer. I love looking at\\xa0the pastries, of course, although the window for the traiteur\\xa0items (take out) is\\xa0equally spectacular, with salads served from\\xa0large porcelain bowls, œufs\\xa0en gelée, Bouchées à la Reine puff pastries with rich cream sauce spilling out, gratins, and some very impressive savory tourtes sold by the wedge.\\n\\n\\n\\nInside the shop, underneath the intricately painted and gilded ceiling painted by Paul Baudry (who also decorated the Paris Garnier opera house), it’s hard to stand and gawk because you’ll be dodging locals, popping in to pick up a treat, be it a morning pastry, such as a kugelhof (below), a yeasted cake with raisins and nuts, or a Paris-Brest, fashioned not in the traditional circular\\xa0shape, but long and slender, like an éclair.\\n\\n\\n\\nI skillfully deflected any wrath by iconoclasts if I had called l my own éclair-like riff on Paris-Brest that same name. So I called mine Paris-Paris, in My Paris Kitchen.\\xa0Bravely, Stohrer doesn’t seem to mind (maybe because they don’t have a blog), naming\\xa0their variation of the hazelnut praline-filled choux pastry, which is traditionally round to mimic a bike wheel since the pastry was invented to commemorate a Paris to Brest bike race, the same as the original.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s quite a line-up of classic French pastries at Stohrer but the most famous is the Baba au rhum, a yeast pastry soaked in helluva lot of rum, brushed with apricot jam, and garnished with candied cherries and angelica. The story on their website goes that Chef Stohrer invented this pastry to use up some dry Polish brioche. Other versions credit a Polish kitchen assistant with being the one to soak bread\\xa0in sweet wine to make it a dessert. Since I wasn’t there, I can’t say for sure. But I do know if you’re going to get one in Paris, this is the place to get what is (most likely) the original.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther pastries include Mont-Blanc (below), a spaghetti-like mound of chestnut cream topped with a candied chestnut. Every winter\\xa0holiday\\xa0season, people write to me, asking how to candy chestnuts like these. The process to making marrons glacés is pretty challenging, especially if you hope to get a bunch of entier (whole) ones after all that simmering and cooking over the course of several days. Which explains their hefty price tag, often selling for as much as €4 a pop. So it’s no wonder people want to make their own!\\n\\n\\n\\nRoses are popular in Paris pastries, many crediting Pierre Hermé\\xa0for starting the trend with his Ispahan, a mélange of rose, lychee and raspberry flavors. Rose-flavored desserts are not my favorite – I’m a chocolate, or lemon, guy – but I can certainly appreciate the beauty that goes into making macarons that riff off those flavors.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was heading out the door to go over there recently, I ran into a neighbor and after a brief chat because I was in a hurry, he asked where I was going. “Stohrer,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said, “Oh, they have the best tarte du citron. I love them!” So I was extra-anxious to hoof it over there. And sure enough, the lemon tart was excellent. Some in Paris can land on the sweet side, but I like lemon tarts that lean more toward\\xa0tart and tangy, with just a touch of sugar to balance the juicy acidity of the lemons. A plouf of whipped cream or meringue on top never hurts\\xa0either.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing a good neighbor, as thanks for the tip, he got a little gift box upon my return. Unlike some of the other bakeries and pastry shops in Paris, Stohrer hasn’t expanded to Las Vegas, New York, or Tokyo, although they do have a rack outside holding the famous postcards depicting their\\xa0line-up of classic pastries, they don’t\\xa0have a line of baba-scented candles or teas being sold as souvenirs. (And personally, I’d prefer to have a lemon tart or chocolate éclair as a gift, rather than a key chain.) In spite of their fancy pastries and decor, they are still a neighborhood bakery, selling baguettes, cakes, chocolates, and even meals, to the constant stream of regulars and visitors who\\xa0come into this historic pastry shop\\xa0seven days a week.\\n\\nStohrer\\n51, rue Montorgueil (2nd)\\nTél: 01 42 33 38 20\\nMétro: Sentier or Etienne Marcel\\n\\nOpen daily, 7:30am to 8:30pm\\n', 'Tuesday, January 26, 2016 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you didn’t have a nonna to do so when you were a \\n\\n, it’s more than likely that Marcella Hazan was the person who introduced you to the concept of a spaghetti frittata, a cozy mess of leftover spaghetti, scrambled egg, some butter, parsley and a fistful of parmesan, cooked in a skillet and cut into wedges. It’s unfancy food at its best, as should be no surprise from the woman who was very distressed by complicated chefs’ recipes, wondering \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when I first saw Food & Wine’s Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie on Pinterest earlier this month, as one does, my first thought was “Oooh, so impossible-to-achieve outside a food styling studio pretty,” (because, I mean, look at it) followed by “Wait, that’s not cacio e pepe” (a Roman dish with exactly three ingredients — pecorino, black pepper and spaghetti, usually fresh tonnarelli, and if you can forgive me for being pedantic, definitely no cheddar), followed by “Wouldn’t all of that egg custard leak from my springform?” (answer: yes, and woe is my oven floor) and then “I wonder what Marcella Hazan would have thought of this.” Would she have been distraught by the springform, perturbed by the use of three types of cheese, shaking her head over the finish under the broiler?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, if she’s anything like the rest of us, I think she’d be too busy enjoying it to ask such questions because this dish — which I’d liken to the halfway point between a spaghetti frittata and a spaghetti quiche — is spectacular. I made it on a whim a couple weeks ago (because that’s my thing these days) and even though my peeling wood-veneer kitchen counter is the furthest cry from a photography studio, it was a total stunner. And while this is unequivocally comfort food — pasta, eggs, and a glorious amount of cheese, yesss — something about eating it in tall wedges with a green salad felt almost civilized, humble food raised to its most centerpiece-worthy calling, and all from just a handful of ingredients. We’re going to be making this a lot this winter, I can tell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne year ago: Caramelized Onion and Gruyere Biscuits\\nTwo years ago: Homemade Dulce de Leche\\nThree years ago: Intensely Chocolate Sables\\nFour years ago: Potato Chip Cookies\\nFive years ago: Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce\\nSix years ago: Black Bean Soup with Toasted Cumin Seed Crema + Cranberry Syrup and an Intensely Almond Cake\\nSeven years ago: Mushroom Bourguignon and Sugar Puffs\\nEight years ago: Leek and Swiss Chard Tart\\nNine years ago: Grapefruit Yogurt Cake and Pasta with Sausage Tomatoes and Mushrooms\\n\\nAnd for the other side of the world:\\nSix Months Ago: Tomato and Fried Provolone Sandwich\\n1.5 Years Ago: Bourbon Slush Punch\\n2.5 Years Ago: Mama Canales-Garcia’s Avocado Shrimp Salsa\\n3.5 Years Ago: Zucchini Bread Pancakes\\n4.5 Years Ago: Corn, Buttermilk and Chive Popovers\\n\\n\\nSpaghetti Pie with Pecorino and Black Pepper\\nAdapted from Justin Chapple at Food & Wine\\n\\nThis pie plays off the flavors of classic cacio e pepe — these flavors will be, delightfully, the strongest — but, of course, I fiddled with it a little. The first time, I made it with 8 ounces each of pecorino romano and fontina (because although I love cheddar, I just couldn’t). The second time, I made with less of each (which was a mistake) and because I’ve become That Person, the kind of person that needs to see some green before I can allow something to become a regular meal, I added about a cup of blanched and finely chopped broccoli rabe (which was not). That said, while we enjoyed our green-flecked spaghetti wedges, we agreed we’d have liked it just as much with the greens on the side, preferably in a garlicky and pepper flake sauteed heap. \\n\\nA few important cooking notes: You must wrap your springform tightly in foil or you and your oven floor will end up in a very bad mood. Please (I beg here) cook your pasta until it’s a good two minutes from done as it will continue cooking in the oven and mushy pasta makes me sad. The greens here are optional (see above) but keep in mind that if you add them, you’ll want to do your best to remove every extra drop of moisture and anticipate that it will take longer to set. Finally, to me, good aged pecorino (usually sold with a black rind) makes all the difference here in providing a salty, funky kick. You can use parmesan if it’s all you’ve got, but you might find that you need more salt if you do.\\n\\u2003\\nButter for greasing springform\\n1/2 pound broccoli rabe, toughest stems saved for another use, chopped into few-inch segments (optional)\\n1 pound dried spaghetti\\n1 1/2 cups milk\\n3 large eggs, lightly beaten\\n2 to 3 teaspoons ground black pepper\\n2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt\\n8 ounces aged pecorino cheese, finely grated, divided\\n8 ounces fontina cheese, grated, divided\\n\\nHeat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and this is very important, wrap the outside of the springform, focusing on the places where the ring meets the base, tightly in aluminum foil. Set aside.\\n\\nBring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. If using broccoli rabe, add it to the pot and boil for 1 to 2 minutes, until it has some give. Fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain it well. Set aside.\\n\\nAdd spaghetti to boiling water and cook until (this is also important) 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente, as the spaghetti will continue cooking in the oven. Drain well and let cool slightly.\\n\\nIf using broccoli rabe, wring all extra moisture out of it and blot greens on paper towels to be extra careful. Mince rabe into very small bits. You’ll have about 1 cup total.\\n\\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs and milk together with salt and pepper. Stir in all but 1/2 cup of each cheese and chopped rabe, if using. Add spaghetti and toss to coat. \\n\\nPour into prepared springform and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (without greens) and up to 15 minutes more (with greens, as they add moisture too), until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the pie and turned slightly will not release any loose egg batter into the center. If the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.\\n\\nTurn on your oven’s broiler. Broil the pie a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned on top. Cut along springform ring to loosen, then remove ring. Run a spatula underneath the pie to loosen the base and slide onto a serving plate. Cut into wedges.\\n\\nSee more: Casserole, Italian, Pasta, Photo, Vegetarian, Winter \\n\\nDo more: Link | Bookmark \\n | Pin | Print\\n | Email\\n | 136 Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n1\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\ndeb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n2\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\nAllie\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n3\\nIf I were able to get around my city (DC) without careening into huge snow banks today, I’d rush out and get these ingredients right now… it’s stunning! \\nAlso, just a little sidebar speaking of Marcella Hazan… have you ever tried her smothered cabbage or smothered cabbage and rice soup?

A tip for the leaky springform pan is to cut a slightly bigger round of parchment paper and lock the springform pan over it so that it acts like a washer in a faucet, but you must use one with the outer lip as shown in the photos above. Only a bead of cheese sauce will ooze out. I am afraid Martha Stewart’s latest cheesecake pan only at Macy’s  is the easiest solution. With a  normal springform pan the leakage can seep under the cavity under the overturned bottom (so there is no lip to catch the product after baking) filling it up. In any case always use a parchment round in the upside down bottom of a cheesecase pan—you can then just slide off the finished result.\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nThis is called a “timballo”, similar to Food and Wine, May 2015, Justin Chapple: Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie (yes, it has white cheddar and fontina besides the pecorino, but it works, this is quite different from the classic cacio e pepe pasta).

It was a delicious way to use the leftover pasta from the night before. It is still one of my favorites made by my Nonna and my mother as well. Our family’s tradition is to use the leftover pasta with red meat sauce mixed in, add some diced  thick-cut cooked pancetta or even dried sweet italian sausage bits, along with egg, a bit of milk and cheese. Mix it up throw it in a cast iron pan and cook on stove on low til starts to set, then finish in the oven. I do love the idea of adding some greens though! Love it for breakfast cold….yum.\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\nBeing raised in Italian households, spaghetti pie wasn’t something you made fresh.

And because I couldn’t find the 9″ springform pan (where IS that thing hiding?!), I baked this in a tube pan and the unexpected upside was more crispy edges, which was my favorite part.\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\nThis was easy and so incredibly good.

Such an awesome root.\\xa0Really affordable to buy, filled with flavour and so versatile to use. Plus, it’s thick, wrinkly, handle cold temperatures well and can therefor be harvested all through the winter. We had some celeriac left in the fridge after we had made this dish and used some of those leftovers to make thin and crispy celeriac chips and chopped the rest into a carrot & celeriac soup that, with a dash of white wine, was right on point.\\n\\nBut we are not here for\\xa0the leftovers, are we? We are here because of this little vegan lasagna made on thinly shaved celeriac and parsnip “noodles” that are layered with a tomato & lentil sauce, mushrooms\\xa0and spinach\\xa0and then covered with cherry tomatoes and baked until soft.\\xa0For a long time we\\xa0refused to call it lasagna, as we know that people can be a little cranky with words. The\\xa0recipe is made entirely without\\xa0lasagna noodles and béchamel sauce which probably is what technically makes a lasagna. But in the end we just thought lasagna sounded more appealing than casserole\\xa0and it also gives a more\\xa0visual description\\xa0of how this dish is layered. Our little gif animation further down in this post, also helps with that.\\n\\nRegardless of its name, this is\\xa0damn tasty\\xa0and perfect winter food. The roots don’t soak up liquid like lasagna so it stays juicy without the need to add a creamy sauce. However, if you\\xa0feel like throwing some dairy\\xa0into it, we can recommend whisking a good ricotta with some lemon juice\\xa0and spreading it out\\xa0as an extra layer in the\\xa0middle.\\n\\n\\n\\nReplacing lasagna noodles with thinly sliced celeriac is a\\xa0great little trick that unfortunately was not invented by us. There are a bunch of recipes out there, from Gordon Ramsey’s double cream version\\xa0to Sarah Britton’s\\xa0with butternut squash.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn another note, yesterday\\xa0we put a major\\xa0deadline behind us (which is why we have been so slow with new blog recipes). It feels great\\xa0and we will tell you all about that project\\xa0soon.\\xa0Now we are actually off to Asia to sip coconuts,\\xa0sleep for a\\xa0hundred years and hug or kids, but we have prepared a whole array of Christmas recipes that we will post\\xa0next week. And a really\\xa0beautiful and tasty\\xa0breakfast that we’ll post\\xa0after Christmas\\xa0– just\\xa0when you are looking for something fresh again. So check back soon!\\n\\n\\n\\nCeleriac Lasagna AKA\\xa0Shaved Roots & Mushroom Casserole\\nServes 6-8\\n\\nTomato & Lentil Sauce\\n1 tbsp coconut oil, butter, ghee or olive oil\\n 1 onion\\n3\\xa0garlic cloves\\n 1/4 tsp chili flakes\\n 4 cans (6 cups / 1560\\xa0g) chopped tomatoes\\n 1/2 cup (125 ml) puy lentils (or lentils of choice), rinsed\\n 1 cup (250 ml) water\\n 2 sprigs thyme, chopped\\n20\\xa0leaves basil, chopped\\n sea salt and pepper\\n\\nShaved roots\\n 1 small celeriac root\\n 3 parsnip roots\\n\\n1 tbsp coconut oil, butter, ghee or olive oil\\n 2 clove garlic\\n 20 brown mushrooms\\n 250 g frozen spinach, thawed (fresh is fine too)\\n 20 cherry tomatoes (or 4 regular tomatoes), sliced\\n\\nPreheat the oven to 350°F / 175°C.\\n\\nPreparing the tomato & lentil sauce: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic and chili flakes and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients\\xa0and stir to combine. Cover with a lid and let simmer for about 45 minutes, until the lentils are soft and the sauce is quite ‘dry’.\\n\\nPreparing the celeriac and parsnip lasagna noodles: Rinse the roots well, then peel, you might want to use a knife instead of a peeler. Cut the roots in halves (or quarters if it’s large). Slice it in very thin slices, best and easiest done with a mandolin slicer (3 mm slices). Alternatively use a sharp knife, but be careful, and slice as thin as possible.\\n\\nPreparing the mushrooms: Clean the mushrooms\\xa0with a soft brush (baking brush or toothbrush), if they are very dirty wash them with a little water and dry well. Slice the stem and the cap lengthwise into large pieces. Heat oil and garlic in a skillet on medium-high heat, add mushrooms\\xa0and\\xa0for a couple of minutes until browned on one side, then stir. Fry for a couple more minutes and pour into a bowl. Now add the thawed spinach to the same skillet with out rinsing. When heated, set aside.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssembling the lasagna: In an oven proof dish, start with a thin layer of oil, cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of half of the tomato sauce and cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of mushrooms +\\xa0spinach and a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of the remaining tomato sauce and arrange the sliced tomatoes on top to cover the tomato sauce. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n', '\\n\\n[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]\\n\\nWhat do my redheaded partner, Kate, and the spicy tomato sauce arrabbiata have in common? Easy: They both look innocent enough, but watch out, because underneath lies a fiery streak that, when unleashed, will leave you wondering what you did to invite such an assault.\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll be honest, I love them both for it.\\n\\nThe one big difference, though, is that with Kate, I don\\'t always get to choose when she breathes fire*, while, with arrabbiata, I can decide not only when I\\'m willing to take the heat but also exactly how much heat I\\'m willing to take. That\\'s really the main thing to know about arrabbiata, because otherwise it\\'s a dead-simple sauce—tomato sauce, made spicy enough to deserve its \"angry\" name.\\n\\n* Well, unless you consider not listening, not asking thoughtful follow-up questions, and not holding up my end of the conversation a choice.\\n\\nYou have two main decisions, therefore, when making arrabbiata. The first is what kind of tomato sauce you want to use, and the other is how spicy you want to make it.\\n\\nFor the first part, you have several options. Most of the time, and particularly during colder months when tomatoes are out of season, I use canned whole tomatoes, which I crush by hand to form a chunky sauce. You could also purée them for a smoother sauce, if that\\'s more appealing. They are far better than any hothouse tomato out there.\\n\\nIf you do find good tomatoes at the market, it\\'s worth considering fresh instead. That might mean cooking diced ripe tomatoes in the oil just until they start to break down, or making a coulis from fresh tomatoes, or even using a more involved fresh sauce, like the one I devised a couple of years ago.\\n\\nThe spice level is a highly personal decision, which makes precise measurements in a recipe difficult. Not only do different people have wildly different heat tolerances, but different chilies, whether fresh or dried, can have a broad range of intensities. So really, the ball\\'s in your court there. You know how hot your chilies are, and you know how much heat you can handle, so act accordingly.\\n\\nThat said, I would encourage you to push the heat level to the edge of what you can tolerate. After all, this isn\\'t \"mildly annoyed\" sauce or \"kinda peeved\" sauce, and it\\'s definitely not \"you\\'re starting to make me cross\" sauce. No, it\\'s \"angry\" sauce. I think you want to aim just below \"frothing at the mouth\" and just above \"pissed off.\" It\\'s a sauce that should look you in the eyes right before you take your first bite and say, with a sad and futile earnestness, \"Don\\'t make me angry...you wouldn\\'t like me when I\\'m angry\"—even though you both know, deep down in your bones, that it\\'s a fait accompli. Bruce Banner will become the Hulk, and arrabbiata shall fulfill its destiny, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaking it starts out just like a typical aglio, olio, e peperoncino, gently cooking garlic and red pepper flakes in oil to extract their heat and flavor, except that here you\\'re going heavy on the red pepper.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, add the tomatoes in whatever form you\\'ve chosen, and simmer it all together. Guess what? You\\'re done! Well, almost. You should probably season it with a little salt.\\n\\nAt this point, you can finish your pasta in it. Here, I\\'ve gone with penne, a common arrabbiata choice, but all sorts of shapes will work. The rest of the process follows the classic way of finishing pasta in its sauce.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do that by heating the sauce in a skillet. (If you\\'ve just made the sauce, it\\'ll already be hot and in the skillet.) Then transfer the cooked pasta to the sauce, along with a few tablespoons of its cooking water. If you ignore the common advice to use a huge pot of water and go with a smaller pot instead, you\\'ll end up with starchier water, which will help bind the sauce better.\\n\\nOnce the sauce has reduced enough that it doesn\\'t look watery anymore, go ahead and remove it from the heat, then quickly stir in cheese. I toss in some chopped parsley at this point, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it, ready to eat. Couldn\\'t be easier. It\\'s so easy, in fact, that the only emotion you should be feeling is pure, unadulterated happiness. The only thing that shouldn\\'t be happy in this situation is the pasta in the bowl.\\n', \"\\n\\t    Take a walk through the freezer section at any grocery store and you're likely find almost an entire aisle devoted to microwavable meals. From rice bowls to mac and cheese to lasagna — the options are endless. But even the ones that claim to be nutritious or healthful don't beat an equally quick meal made at home with the aid of the microwave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t   When you're in a pinch or just want one less pot or pan to clean, let the microwave be the solution for a quick meal you make at home, at the office, or in your dorm.\\n\\n\\n1. Think simply.\\n\\n\\n\\t     While the microwave can really accomplish more kitchen tasks than you might think, it really thrives when left to do simple jobs, and cooking eggs is one of its best examples. Use it to make a quick poached egg, which you can place on top of some mixed greens for an easy lunch. Or whip up a fast omelet for breakfast. Heck, even go and cook up some bacon while you're at it.\\n\\n\\n2. Use quick-cooking ingredients.\\n\\n\\n\\t     One reason pastas and macaroni and cheese bowls are abundant in the microwavable meals department is that they are made up of ingredients that cook up relatively quickly. Whether its dry pasta being cooking for a one-bowl serving of mac and cheese, or a carefully prepared sauce that makes reheating a breeze, pasta is a favorite for meals that are made to be microwaved.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More: How To Make One-Bowl Microwave Macaroni and Cheese\\n\\n\\n3. Lean on leftovers.\\n\\n\\n\\t     Maybe there's not enough of yesterday's chili to just reheat it in the microwave and call it dinner, but there just might be enough to repurpose it into something entirely new with help from your microwave. Use it make some hearty baked potatoes or creamy polenta, which are the perfect vehicles for leftover chili, stew, and even stir-fries, turning them into a meal again.\\n\\n\\n4. Reach for a mug.\\n\\n\\n\\t     Mugs really are an efficient way to cook in the microwave because they hold and distribute heat well. If you need to kick a sugar craving quickly, a mug cake can be your savior — especially when there's Nutella involved. And while making French toast or pancakes in a mug won't be quite the same as making them the traditional way, they're just as satisfying and can be made in a whole lot less time.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More: 10 Breakfast Recipes You Can Make in a Mug in the Microwave\\n\\n\\n5. Don't forget your vegetables.\\n\\n\\n\\t     If you haven't tried steaming vegetables in the microwave yet, you really should. You can steam broccoli or any other vegetable, be it carrots, green beans, or cauliflower, using just a microwave safe-bowl and plate. After cooking, toss them with a little olive oil or butter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper and maybe even a little grated Parmesan cheese or crumbled feta. Add the vegetables to that pasta or polenta you made and you've got a light and healthy meal.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More: How to Steam Broccoli in the Microwave\\n\\n\\n\\n(Image credits: Emma Christensen)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\t   Smoothies are one of our favorite breakfast options year-round, but especially in the winter because it's an easy way to brighten the mornings by adding extra fruit to our diets. And since frozen fruit works just as well (if not better — hello, icy, creamy texture), there's no worry about whether it's in season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t   If you're stuck in the doldrums of gray days, try these tropical smoothies. It won't be quite like you're relaxing on a white-sand beach, but it'll be closer to it than your normal bowl of oatmeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         Sometimes, you just have to go with a classic. This smoothie recipe is one of our standbys. We might dress it up or down with a touch of mint or swap in coconut water, but we can always count on it to be delicious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         You'll definitely get bonus points if you use a fresh coconut to make this smoothie. But because we know mornings are hectic, you can also swap in a can of coconut milk, and it will be just as creamy and delicious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t        Adding mint to your smoothie is a total pro move. Not only does it amplify the fresh taste, but it also makes it feel slightly more like dessert than a healthy breakfast. This smoothie also has a pinch of sea salt to boost all the other flavors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t       Don't be fooled by the nondescript hue of this smoothie; it's packed full of tropical flavors including banana, pineapple, mango, and ginger. Plus it gets an added texture from the chia seeds that are mixed in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t      This rich smoothie is perfect for cooler weather, thanks to the warming spices like cardamom and cinnamon. But before you think it'll taste too much like banana bread, there's a squeeze of lime juice mixed in for a bit of brightness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t     If you like cilantro, this should be the next smoothie recipe that you try. The subtle spice of the cilantro offsets the sweetness of the pineapple and banana and starts your morning off with an herby kick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         Not only does this smoothie get a nutritional boost from fresh (or ground) turmeric, but it also has oats as its base to give it a nice dairy-free creamy consistency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    This is the perfect way to use up any of those kiwis that you had the best of intentions of using, but that have been languishing on your counter for just a touch too long. Blend them up with coconut milk, avocado, and some lemon juice (along with water and ice) and you'll end up with a delicious and creamy breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t        If you have a restricted diet, this is the smoothie template to try. It relies on silken tofu for creaminess, agave syrup for sweetness, and soy milk for smoothness. The only decision you have to make is what kind of fruit to mix in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         If you want to make mornings even easier on yourself, try prepping your smoothie ingredients for the week over the weekend and stashing them in the freezer. Then all you have to do is blend and go.

Too hard or too time consuming, you may think. But if you’ve ever accidentally over-whipped your cream until it looks slightly curdled (and I think we all have), you may be surprised to hear that you’ve actually already made butter. While butter used to be a tedious and time consuming process, nowadays we have helpful tools like blenders and stand mixers than can whip up a batch of butter in minutes.\\n\\nUnlike sweet cream butter which uses fresh cream, European-style or cultured butter has a remarkable richness and depth of flavor that can’t be matched: the complex, tangy flavor that comes from the culturing process is well worth the extra 6 hours if you can bear to wait that long. If you’ve ever been to France and indulged in some of their amazing butter (seriously, I could live on French butter), then you know how amazing cultured butter is… regular, store-bought butter just can’t compare. The other secret of French butter? Salt. Sure, you can leave your homemade butter unsalted, but unless you are baking with it, I highly recommend you add salt, as it’ll take your butter to a whole other level.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve seen recipes that use fresh yogurt or buttermilk as their starter, but after my mediocre yogurt-making experience, I chose to use straight mesophilic culture (if you’re curious, I got a butter making kit on amazon that has everything you need to get started, culture included). This gets added to the fresh cream then left at room temperature for 6 hours. Sure enough… it will thicken and have a slightly sour smell very similar to yogurt.\\n\\nAfter that all it takes is a quick whir in the blender, followed by a series of rinses to remove excess buttermilk (I find this to be the most tedious part of the whole process, but it’s an important one, as butter that’s not thoroughly rinsed will spoil quicker). Basically you want to keep rinsing your butter with fresh, cold water until the liquid runs clear. Be patient with it, it’ll come around, I promise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, what to do with all your amazing homemade butter once you’ve made it? Make toast, of course. Since we’re following in the French tradition anyway with our cultured butter, we may as well copy them as well and make butter sandwiches. Yes, the French butter their sandwiches before they add meat and cheese (I knew I liked the French). Top your toasted and generously buttered crusty bread with a few slices of soft brie cheese and jambon de Bayonne (French prosciutto). You can also take the same idea South Italy, with prosciutto and pecorino cheese, or West to Spain, with ibérico or serrano ham and manchego cheese.\\n\\nButter is universal.\\n\\nGet the full recipe on the Kitchenthusiast blog »\\n\\n\\n\\nHomemade European-Style Butter\\n\\nYield: 8 ounces (1 cup or 2 standard sticks)\\n\\nPrep Time: 6 hours\\n\\nTotal Time: 7 hours\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n2 cups heavy cream, room temperature (65-68ºF)\\n\\n1/8 teaspoon mesophilic culture (optional, for cultured butter. Can be purchased where cheese-making supplies are sold)\\n\\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or butter salt (optional, for salted butter)\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nStir mesophilic culture into room temperature cream (65-68ºF). Lightly cover and place in a warm dry spot for 6 hours or until thickened. If the cream has warmed over 68ºF, refrigerate until it drops back down to temperature (it will not properly churn if it is too warm).

At just $356.70, it comes sweetly packed in a manila-and-bubble-wrap envelope that will look perfectly rumpled when it arrives at your door.\\n\\nThe Makers\\n\\nThe makers, Torn and Pulp Ledger, were born and raised in and will never leave Brooklyn (\"are there even other cities out there?,\" Torn asks me via Snapchat video). They wanted me to mention that they were both accepted to Harvard but decided against college, intent as they were on solving \"majorly annoying\" world issues instead.\\n\\nTheir company—Cornice & Grout—was born a few years back, with the single goal of coming up with something, anything, to write on. From these studies, this new pad of paper was born.\\n\\nMaking Paper\\n\\nThe first step towards a good pad of paper is, as Torn and Pulp knew by Googling, good paper. They looked for a local paper mill, but the closest one turned out to be in New Jersey—so they started processing paper pulp in an antique butter churner in their Brooklyn townhouse instead. \"If a pad of paper\\'s not local,\" Torn asked me to consider, \"what\\'s the point?\"\\n\\nProcessing paper smells heinous, so the brothers spent years collaborating with Glade on a line of plug-in HEPA filters that smell like the air at Smorgasbord, before returning to the task at hand.\\n\\nInspired by a Pinterest post they once saw and now can\\'t find anywhere, Torn and Pulp upcycled used iPhone parts into faux-paper pulp in a patented process that takes place in India (\"we\\'re basically treehugrs,\" Torn types on a Word doc on his screen and points to while I\\'m sitting next to him), before the material is brought to their plant in Brooklyn.\\n\\nTo Dye or Not to Dye\\n\\nTo make their paper stand out, the Ledger brothers chose to dye the pulp with strands of saffron harvested from the Greek island of Nisyros, a place that holds no special meaning for them. Did they consider turmeric, for a paper with spice and more medicinal qualities, I asked? \"No,\" Torn Facetimed to tell me.\\n\\nInstead of using a printer to print lines on their paper, the brothers decided to take a more hands-on approach. \"Yes, we actually hand-stencil every line on every piece of paper,\" Pulp G-chatted me at 4 A.M., \"can you please make sure everyone knows that\\'s why they won\\'t ship for a month?\"\\n\\nAt about 50 sheets each, it takes roughly a month to line a whole pad of paper, factoring in daily breaks for when the weed or Maple delivery person arrives. On the increased likelihood that this introduces opportunity for human error, Torn comments: \"If we mess up, we just toss the whole pad into the Gowanus Canal and start over.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor ink, they use squid ink thinned out with that very canal water, the former harvested from a giant pet cephalopod called Larb that lives in offshore near Rockaway Beach. \"We go surf, and if we see the squid, we grap up some ink before hitting the subway home,\" they email me in a new email thread disconnected to all our other email threads (\"who even replies anymore?\" Pulp asks in a direct Instagram message).\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nIf you like, you can just use your Pad to write notes on, but as Pulp and Torn say, \"We don\\'t really use ours for writing on, because they\\'re so special!\" Other uses:\\n\\nArt. Use a metallic duct tape to secure the pad of paper to the wall, where you can admire it.\\n\\nA Series of Artworks. Carefully tear off each page, have it matted and framed, and hang them in a grid.\\n\\nOrigami. Each sheet is a rectangle, but you can trim them down to squares and whip up a series of small paper cranes that would look neat hung from the ceiling with fishing line in a sedge.\\n\\nBlinds. Tear off all the sheets, and bing them together along the edges so they form one large sheet. Secure this with packing tape over your window for a yellow-ish glow.\\n\\nWindow Cleaners. As Leslie mentioned here, using scrunched up newspaper to do the final dry will leave your windows streak-free—and you could test that out with this pad of papers!\\n\\nPaper Pad in the Wild\\n\\nEveryone loves it.\\n\\nArtists:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKids:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReally Bored People:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Dickens:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to check out what else is new in the Food52 Shop?\\n\\nWhat should Cornice & Grout focus on making next?

Just how far can this trend go? I mean, we already have sushi burritos — why should we stop at burgers? Will sushi tacos storm the Taco Tuesday scene? Will sushi donuts be the next great breakfast treat? Will spiralized sushi sweep the nation as the next health-food craze?

But Indianapolis’s food scene is growing (so says Bon Appetit) and with it, we can now get real ramen\\xa0— “real” being authentic, fresh noodle ramen with complex savory broth, not the 50-cent flavor-packet variety.\\n\\nOne of our favorite ways to get inspiration for our kitchen is to go out to restaurants and taste new flavor combinations, either in our own city or when travelling.\\xa0Mediterranean\\xa0and Mexican\\xa0cuisines are our comfort zone, but\\xa0after\\xa0grabbing ramen at a local restaurant (Rook) this weekend, we were inspired to up our Japanese slash Korean game.\\n\\nOur restaurant ramen experience was fantastic — savory broth full of umami (that fifth savory sense), creamy poached egg, curly noodles, if you’re me, spicy sriracha: the ultimate\\xa0comfort food in a bowl. When we went to recreate it to our kitchen, however, we tried for\\xa0vegetarian ramen and found we couldn’t quite create the savory, slow-cooked broth we were looking for. (But not for lack of trying.) So instead, we revamped\\xa0the recipe into a quick, easy and fresh version, made with vegetable broth and aromatics like ginger and garlic, with a ton of vegetables thrown in: greens, shiitake mushrooms, peppers, green onion, radishes. And to top it off, we were able to find fresh ramen noodles from our local Asian grocery.\\n\\nAnd guess what: not only did we bring our camera (which produced one of our favorite shoots ever), this time we brought our microphone along for the ride!

Gently lower the eggs into the water with a spoon and simmer for 7 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a bowl of ice water. When the eggs are done, place them in the ice bath and let them cool completely, then gently peel. Keep the water in the pot and use it to cook the ramen (go to Step 4).\\n\\nMeanwhile, thinly slice 4 cloves garlic. Peel and mince 1 tablespoon ginger. In another pot, heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil and 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and saute for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 1 quart broth and bring to a simmer. Add 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon mirin.\\n\\nRemove the stems from the shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice them. If necessary, wash the greens. Thinly slice the sweet peppers and green onions (cut the onions on the bias). Thinly slice 4 radishes for a garnish, and set aside. Place the mushrooms in the broth and cook 5 minutes. Add peppers, green onion and greens and cook for 1 minute.\\n\\nMeanwhile, reheat the water used for the eggs and boil the ramen noodles until just tender, around 2 to 3 minutes.\\n\\nTo serve, place noodles in a bowl and top with broth and vegetables.

I could never…go to the gym. Eat healthy. Run a marathon. Speak in public. Learn the piano. My “I could never” for the longest time was “I could never learn to cook.” No, seriously. It was my scapegoat so I could get out caring about what I put into my body. Content with my microwave meals, I was good to go because cooking was not my thing. \\n\\nAs life has rolled along it revealed hidden “I could nevers” that I have overcome, not realizing their existence until they had passed. I could never eat vegetarian. I could never overcome cancer. I could never weather a miscarriage. The more life has thrown at me, the more I realize the limiting power of our speech, those words. Because really, we can. \\n\\nI tell people all the time that writing about food and health is the last thing I thought I’d be doing. But somehow through a series of small “I can’s”, I’ve ended up here. Simple as it sounds, the impossible can become possible merely by opening our minds to the idea. \\n\\nThis recipe was born of another I could never, which Alex and I honestly both had before we tried it: I could never eat pizza without cheese. We’re huge (huge) pizza aficionados, and while we eat mainly vegetarian in our daily lives, there’s always a place for cheese at the table. However, we’re always up for trying new things, and as of late we’ve been trying to take it a little easier on the cheese food group when we can. As our first ever vegan pizza, we can attest that — good news — it is still pizza! The umami of the mushrooms and artichokes + our favorite tomatoes (Muir Glen Organic fire roasted) + a little fresh basil made for a surprisingly satisfying explosion of flavor. The one caveat is that it doesn’t hold together quite as easily as cheese-ladden pizza, so take care for sliding toppings. But it’s a small price to pay. Consider it another I could never, accomplished.\\n\\n\\nVery Veggie Vegan Pizza\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nby: a Couple Cooks\\n\\nServes: 1 large pizza\\n\\nWhat To Do\\n\\nPrepare the dough using either the stand mixer or food processor methods (you also can knead by hand; follow this video instruction for more). Follow the preparation instructions in the dough recipe if prepared in advance.\\n\\nPlace a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 550°F.\\n\\nPrepare the toppings: Slice the jarred red pepper into thin strips and set aside. Mince 3 cloves garlic. Slice the mushrooms and red onion. Drain and rinse the chickpeas. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the garlic, mushrooms, onion, chickpeas, and spinach and ½ teaspoon kosher salt; saute until the mushrooms are tender and the spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.\\n\\nWhen the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle (see this video for instructions). Place the dough on a floured pizza peel or pull the pizza stone out of the oven and carefully place the dough on it.\\n\\nQuickly assemble the pizza: Spread a thin layer of crushed tomatoes across the dough and sprinkle with a few pinches kosher salt. Add the sauteed vegetables, then top with red pepper strips and artichoke quarters. Lightly brush the crust with olive oil.\\n\\nTransfer the pizza to the oven on the pizza peel, and bake until the crust is browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. While the pizza bakes, cut the basil into thin strips (chiffonade). Allow to cool slightly, then top with basil and serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5.3208\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\t The efforts to combat overfishing have reached a new frontier: faux foods. Certainly most people are familiar with krab, but are you ready to dig in to a plate of faux shrimp?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t I have to admit, I\\'m a little wary. With an ingredient list that contains broken-down red algae and a production process that\\'s been compared to baking bread, New Wave\\'s product doesn\\'t sound wholly appetizing. Even so, I definitely appreciate that they\\'re doing all of this in the efforts of saving the oceans and to combat the prevalence of forced labor in the fishing industry. Despite my reservations about eating algae, I\\'d give them a try!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t The good news is that early reports indicate that the faux shrimp really are good. One writer declared the elastic texture \"nearly perfect,\" which is quite impressive considering how unique the consistency of real shrimp is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t If you\\'re eager to start adding faux shrimp to your weekly menu, you won\\'t have to wait long! New Wave plans to launch their first product, pre-breaded popcorn shrimp, near the end of the year or the beginning of 2017. Are you ready to try it?\\n\\n\\n\\n(Image credits: Leela Cyd)\\n\\n', '\\nBrunch is one of my favorite meals, but it often involves a lot of last minute preparation if you are the one hosting it. Eggs, salads and baked goods all need to be prepared either just before people arrive, or just before you sit down to eat. You can help the eggs along by making a breakfast casserole, but you can save even more time by preparing this fantastic Overnight Coffee Cake. The coffee cake – and you can get the recipe over on the Craftsy blog (it’s free!) – and the streusel are both prepared the night before you intend to bake and the assembled cake is refrigerated until it is ready to go in the oven. The resulting cake has a soft, even crumb and just the right amount of crunchy streusel topping. Your guests will never know how much time you saved (or that you got to sleep in for an extra hour!) by serving up this amazing cake.\\n\\nIf you prefer nuts in your coffee cake, you can stir in about a 1/2 cup or so of finely chopped nuts while preparing the batter.

As Eric puts it, \"You can\\'t transmit the feel of leather through an online shop.\" After exploring lots of different options for suppliers in person, he settled on two of the oldest tanneries in the U.S., Herman Oak Leather and Wickett & Craig. What that means is not only is all the leather he uses American-made, but, being \"essentially a by-product of the meat industry,\" it\\'s also not wasteful to procure.\\n\\nEfficiency often leads design.\\n\\nOf course, it\\'s up to the designer to decide what a piece looks like, but cost and material constraints can actually help as creativity-fueling roadblocks. \"I\\'ve found that the woven leather treatment that I employ is one of the most economical ways to use the leather,\" Eric explains. \"I cut the entire side of leather into strips and then cut those strips to the proper length for my chair straps. Out of a 25 square foot hide, I only have about one square foot of waste. In contrast, if I was making a giant leather sling, I could only use the biggest part of a side [of leather], leaving a large amount of waste.\" The resulting basketweave is graphic but still plenty inviting.\\n\\nYou can spray paint leather.\\n\\nThe ombre effect happening on the seat of the chair isn\\'t just natural wear—it\\'s leather dye. \"I put the dye in a spray bottle and just spray it on,\" he explains. The effect is dramatic, playing off the way the material colors naturally where you use it, over time.\\n\\nShop this leather chair and more of Eric\\'s designs at Workof, and share stories of your favorite leather chairs in the comments.\\n\\nTags:\\nworkof, chair design, fabrication, leather\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nFluffy, hearty diner-style omelettes. [Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]\\n\\nJust as with scrambled eggs, there are two major types of omelette: the hearty, big-as-your-face, stuffed-to-the-brim, fluffy, folded-in-half, light-golden-brown diner-style omelette, and its refined French cousin, the moist, tender, pale-yellow variety, gently rolled like the world's most delicious cigar. And, just as with scrambled eggs, the method by which the eggs are heated and stirred is the primary factor that determines what you end up with.\\n\\nI'm not going to weigh in on the controversial subject of which style is better (because I'd prefer not to end up exchanging fisticuffs with Daniel), but let's just say that both of them have their time and place, and leave it at that.\\n\\n\\n\\nDaniel recently showed you how to make French omelettes, so today I'm showing you my technique for diner-style omelettes, excerpted from my book. The faster you agitate your eggs as they cook, the finer the curds they end up forming, which is why you want to vigorously shake and stir French omelettes throughout the entire time they cook. American diner-style omelettes, on the other hand, should be fluffy as opposed to creamy, with large, rustic curds, which means that minimal movement is what you're after.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe key is to start the beaten eggs in hot butter: The browned butter solids help the eggs take on a nice golden color, while higher heat leads to larger, fluffier curds. Then, rather than shaking the pan and breaking up the large curds, the best course of action is a move called the lift-and-tilt: Use a silicone spatula to lift up the edges of the omelette and push them toward the center of the pan, while tilting the pan to allow the raw egg to run underneath. Repeating this technique means that nearly all of the eggs can be set with minimal stirring.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou'll still end up with a slick of raw egg across the top surface, which is easy to take care of: Remove the skillet from the heat, add whatever toppings you like (ham and cheese are my favorites), cover the skillet with a lid, and let the residual heat from the eggs gently cook the top through. Then fold it in half and serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Should I Salt My Eggs?\\n\\nHere's the scenario: You've just beaten a few eggs with a pinch of salt, getting ready to scramble them, when suddenly the dog gets stuck in the toilet, your mother-in-law calls, and the UPS guy rings the doorbell to deliver your brand-new digital thermometer. Thirty minutes later, you get back to those eggs and realize they've completely changed color. Once bright yellow and opaque, they're now dark orange and translucent. What's going on? And, more important, will it affect the way they cook?\\n\\n\\n\\nSalt affects eggs by weakening the magnetic attraction that yolk proteins have for one another (yes, egg proteins do find each other attractive). Egg yolks are made up of millions of tiny balloons filled with water, protein, and fat. These balloons are too small to see with the naked eye, but they are large enough to prevent light from passing through them. Salt breaks these spheres up into even tinier pieces, allowing light to pass through, so the salted eggs turn translucent. What does this mean for the way they cook? To find out, I cooked three batches of eggs side by side, noting their finished texture.\\n\\nSALTING EGGS\\n\\n\\n\\nTurns out that salt can have quite a drastic effect on how eggs cook. When eggs cook and coagulate, the proteins in the yolks pull tighter and tighter together as they get hotter. When they get too tight, they begin to squeeze liquid out from the curds, resulting in eggs that weep in a most embarrassing manner. Adding salt to the eggs well before cooking can prevent the proteins from bonding too tightly by reducing their attraction to one another, resulting in a tenderer curd and lower likelihood of unattractive weeping. Adding salt immediately before cooking helps, but if you want the full effect, the salt must have time to dissolve and become evenly distributed through the mixture. This takes about 15 minutes—just enough time for you to get your bacon cooked or your omelette fillings ready!\\n\\n\\n\\nYour purchase on Amazon helps support Serious Eats.\\n\", \"Rosemary Chicken Salad with Avocado and Bacon\\n\\n\\n10 Smart Points 381 Calories \\n\\n\\n\\nThis hearty Rosemary Chicken Salad with Avocado and Bacon is HUGE – perfect when you want a low-carb meal that will fill you up!\\xa0I actually split this between three people,\\xa0and felt completely satisfied.\\n\\nThis delicious recipe is from Heather Christo’s first cookbook Pure Delicious.

[Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]\\n\\nLike many kids in Asian households in the US, I grew up playing classical music, and I'm constantly surprised by just how similar learning music is to learning how to cook. Take, for instance, your typical progression. In music, you start out learning to play a few songs, focusing on those that will teach you the basic mechanics of finger and arm movements, just as you may focus your early cooking on simple recipes that emphasize knife skills or a technique like sautéing. From there, you might move on to learning individual songs—or recipes—practicing each one until you master it. But it's only when you start focusing on technique and theory that you really start to learn. Practicing a song will teach you one new song, but practicing a new scale or a common chord progression will unlock a whole catalog of music.\\n\\nI feel the same way every time I learn a new cooking technique. What can I do with this one?\\n\\nA couple of months back was the first time that I whipped aquafaba, the goopy liquid inside a can of chickpeas, into a light, foamy, vegan meringue, and it blew my mind. I'm serious about this: A mixer with a whisk attachment and the drained liquid from a can of chickpeas is all you need. I went into a flurry of recipe testing, and you'll be seeing some of the results of that testing in the coming months.\\n\\nIn the grand scheme of things, oatmeal pancakes are not really that different a song from regular pancakes, but you can consider them a remix.\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing aquafaba for vegan oatmeal pancakes is especially successful because oatmeal pancakes tend to be a little denser than, say, buttermilk pancakes to begin with, and aquafaba doesn't have quite the lifting power and structure that eggs do. For these pancakes, I start by toasting oats in a skillet until they're nutty and fragrant, then I grind them up in a food processor and combine them with some standard dry pancake ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking powder and soda, and salt. Next, I whip up the aquafaba into a dense, stable meringue sweetened with just a touch of sugar. Nut milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and a little vinegar (to help with rise) make up the liquid ingredients.\\n\\nI fold everything together, then ladle it onto a moderately hot griddle to bake. \\n\\n\\n\\nThey bake up light, nutty, and flavorful. Perfect for soaking up warm maple syrup, and that's a tune we can all sing along to, whether we're vegan or not.\\n\", 'Chopped fans, ever wonder: Who puts together the mystery baskets? Where does the fourth plate of food go? Does Ted Allen ever get a taste? Do the judges really have to eat that? Chopped host Ted Allen took the time to sit down with Food Network to answer the questions fans have been asking and wondering about through the many seasons of the show. He reveals some of the secrets behind one of the most-popular cooking competition shows on TV.\\n\\nCan anyone tell which chef is going to win before the cooking begins?\\nWell, like everybody else, we kind of pick our favorites as they walk in, and just [keep them] in the back of our minds … . I got it right on our show that we shot last Friday, but you can never really tell, and that’s what’s exciting about it. You never can tell, and even if someone has the best resume, that doesn’t mean that they’re going to get a basket that suits them or that’s full of things that they’re going to succeed with.\\n\\nWhat is your favorite mystery basket ingredient?\\nWell, out of about 5,000 of them, that’s going to be sort of hard. I mean, gosh, Rocky Mountain oysters, chicken feet … we’ve even had eyeballs. My favorite mystery basket ingredient remains the whole chicken in a can, not so much because I love the food, [but because] I love the sound it makes when it plops out of the can.\\n\\nIs there a food that freaked you out because it was placed in the basket, like something out of the ordinary?\\nYeah. Like, most of them. Our baskets can be really, really tough. We have had rabbit in a can, chicken in a can, chicken feet, all kinds of organs, tongues — many different kinds of tongues: duck tongues, cow tongues, lamb tongues, pig tongue. We’ve had pig lips. Yeah, there have been ingredients that freaked me out. Pig nostrils, pig ears, pig tails. But here’s the thing: Some things that sound weird to you and me as Americans are not weird at all in other cultures and other countries. We’ve had bugs. We’ve had mealworms. We’ve had crickets. We’ve had grasshoppers. We’ve had snakes and eels and, you know, foods that are totally ordinary — pig blood, mmm, delicious — foods that are totally ordinary in other countries, and I think that’s part of the excitement. We all like [an] ingredient that’s going to, you know, make a 12-year-old boy go, “Eeew.”\\n\\nDo you ever get to sit down?\\nNo, I never get to sit down. I’ve asked; they said no. I don’t know why they’re obsessed with making me stand up all the time. Maybe it’s kind of like exercise. Yet people in New York City pay good money to exercise, and they have to pay me to do it.\\n\\nIs that why you always wear sneakers?\\nI have an amazing sneaker collection, thanks to our wardrobe stylist, Kitty Boots, and of course these sneakers don’t even have laces on them, which is kind of handy. I mean, I don’t only wear sneakers, but I usually do. It’s because they’re comfy, and they’re easy to get in and out of, so I do like them for that. … Listen, if you’re a cashier or you work in a toll booth and you’re standing all day long, it’s good to have comfy sneakers, comfy kicks.\\n\\nWhat happens to the fourth plate of food? Does somebody eat it? Why don’t you get to taste the food?\\nWe send that fourth plate directly to my dressing room, where I consume it completely every single round. … No, nobody eats that. I’ll tell you why. We need the fourth plate, because if someone gets Chopped I have to have a plate underneath the cloche when I lift it, and you don’t want a plate that’s already been half-eaten, so that’s the main thing. Also, we take close-up shots of that fourth plate. By the time we’re done with that fourth plate, it’s about two and a half hours after it was cooked, and it’s been sitting out at room temperature, so no one’s going to eat that. That wouldn’t be a good idea.\\n\\nWhy do you all loathe truffle oil?\\nFirst of all, truffle oil, there’s a time and a place for most ingredients. … There are different qualities of truffle oils. Some of it is great, some of it’s made with artificial ingredients, so that’s one reason. The second reason is that it became a fad among restaurant chefs to drizzle truffle oil on everything, and so when you’re a creative chef, the way our judges are, you don’t want to be piling onto the bandwagon that everybody else is already on. … Three, it’s a very strong ingredient and can overwhelm everything else, and so combine the fact that we’re a little tired of it, [and] if you use too much of it, it can really overwhelm a dish. And, finally, it just feels like a crutch. Like, people think, “Oh, if I put gold leaf and truffle oil and caviar and all this expensive, fancy stuff on a dish, that’s enough to make it a good dish.” Not really. How about just good cooking?\\n\\nWhere does the show get the leftover ingredients when there’s a leftovers battle?\\nThis is something that we could all relate to. Go to the fridge and there’s nothing in there except cold pizza and, you know, a leftover soda that you didn’t finish. We get those ingredients from totally normal restaurants right here in the Chelsea neighborhood. There’s a pizza joint up the street that makes really nice New York City-style … thin-crust pizza. I remember once a guy put a slice of pizza in the blender and made a sauce out of it, and it was actually good.\\n\\nWhy doesn’t the show have a second ice cream machine? Everybody’s always fighting for the ice cream machine in the dessert round.\\nWell, if it were up to me and the judges, we’d have 20 ice cream machines and make it easier on our contestants. Here’s the dirty little secret: Producers of competition shows don’t want to make it easy for contestants, so they enjoy it when people fight over the ice cream machine. But the fact is, it is totally possible for two batches of ice cream to get made within a 30-minute round, and when that happens, it’s exciting for us. So, I don’t think we’re going to add another ice cream machine.\\n\\nWho is the most-forgiving judge, and who is the least-forgiving judge?\\nThat’s kind of like the question people ask me, “Who’s my favorite judge?” They’re all my favorite, and that’s like, you know, when someone asks “Who’s your favorite kid?” or “who’s your favorite pet?” Our judges are all brilliant in totally different ways. Alex Guarnaschelli has, I would say, the best gift of language of any of our chefs. She can talk, talk, talk and talk so beautifully about food like no one I’ve ever heard. Scott Conant has this seriousness … particularly about foods that matter a lot to him, like pasta. Chris Santos has a similar seriousness, always passionate, always deeply concerned about the cooking. Marcus Samuelsson brings such an international worldview. Everybody has a different skill set, and I think it’s great that they rotate so that we have different people there each time. I would say none of them is especially forgiving when bad cooking happens, but I think they all care deeply about cooking, and they care about people. So, they were all well-chosen, and I love them all.\\n\\nDo the judges have a say in the basket ingredients? After all, they do have to eat them.\\nThe basket ingredients are chosen by a committee that’s led by our staffer Sara Hormi, and Sara’s job is to find us things that we’ve never seen before, which with chefs as great as our judges is a hard thing to do. Once in a while, the judges or myself will look at a basket and say, “This is just too mean or just too hard,” and we’ll ask if something can be switched out, and usually they’ll do that for us if our concerns are legit, but there’s a lot of thought process that goes into choosing those ingredients, and by the way, they’re not chosen randomly. They’re designed to be possible but difficult. … So if we give you, say, tomatillos, flatbreads and silky tofu, obviously we’re looking for a play on grilled cheese and tomato soup, right? The funny thing is the chefs don’t have a lot of time to think about it. In fact, they have no time to think about it, and they really don’t know what the ingredients are, so they don’t usually figure out what the riddle is inside the basket, but there definitely is an intention.\\n\\nHave any of the judges ever gotten sick from the food they had to taste?\\nNo. I have to say after about 5,000 mystery basket ingredients the judges have never gotten sick, knock on wood, from eating the food, and that’s because our culinary department is very serious about food safety, and that’s part of their job … . Just like when you go to a restaurant, you want to have confidence that the food is going to be safe.\\n\\nHave any of the judges ever gagged at the idea of eating something?\\nThere’s a melon that comes from Asia called durian that is very smelly, and some people love it and a lot of people don’t. I remember once we had that in a basket, and Geoffrey Zakarian really didn’t want to take a bite of that durian. The producers kind of made him take one, and I thought he might get sick. He also objected to the idea of tasting an eyeball, and so would I. So, whenever people say, “Why don’t you get to taste the food?’ I always say, “How bad do you think I want to taste eyeballs, chicken feet and Rocky Mountain oysters?”\\n\\nWhat characteristic is most prevalent among Chopped winners?\\nSo, I’ve always wanted to sit down and write a guide on how to win Chopped or how not to lose it, and there are so many things you could try to do. I think practicing is a great idea — I think especially practicing what can you accomplish in 20 minutes, because 20 minutes flies by, 30 minutes flies by. I think the most-important thing you could do is try to cook a bunch of different things within a very strict time frame, and don’t give yourself an extra minute, because we’re not going to. I think winners on Chopped are people who are very open-minded and who are quick at getting an idea and sticking to it, but also who are quick to go to plan B or plan C or plan D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O — I’m trying to see how much of the alphabet I can remember. You have to be able to adjust and regroup very quickly, so I would say [those are] the top things: Be open-minded, be able to come up with an idea very quickly, understand what you can cook inside of 20 or 30 minutes and be ready to change your plan if something goes terribly wrong, because chances are it will.\\n\\nHow long is the judging time, on average?\\nWell, our judges care very deeply about fairness. They base their decision entirely on the food that’s on the plate. The judges make all of the decisions — nobody tells them what to do, nobody could. Imagine telling Alex Guarnaschelli what to do. Good luck with that. Judging takes probably about 15 minutes per round, 15, 20 minutes, and we film it, but you only see little moments of it. Sometimes there has been [an] argument about who should win, which is why we have three judges instead of two or four. So, there can’t be a tie, and those arguments have gone on for 30 or 45 minutes, but usually it’s … often very close … . I have to say it’s actually really hard. It’s not just, “Well, he won round 1 and she won round 2 and then she won round 3, so she wins.” It’s not that simple. … We break it down: Who used each ingredient in each round the best? Who left a mystery basket ingredient off the plate? If someone left an ingredient off the plate, did somebody else do something even worse? It’s actually really complicated. So sometimes it takes a while, but … we have to make sure that the right person wins.\\n\\nWatch Chopped on Tuesdays at 10|9c to see who beats the mystery baskets.\\n', '\\n\\nYay, it’s the weekend! I’m going to be cooking up some delicious things this weekend, but in the mean time I wanted to post this “redo” of one of the first recipes I ever posted on Budget Bytes: Lemon Butter Green Beans. Why? Well, I happened across some incredibly fresh and beautiful green beans yesterday that were also ON SALE, so I just had to have them. The lemon butter treatment is my absolute favorite way to prepare green beans and the original post for this recipe, from waaayyy back in 2009, doesn’t do it justice. I’m doing it again just so that everyone can see how easy, delicious, and inexpensive real food can be.\\xa0This is truly one of those “goes with anything” side dishes, so learn how to make them\\xa0and make them\\xa0often! :)\\n\\nThe combination of fresh lemon and butter gives these green beans a rich yet bright flavor that highlights their natural goodness. The tangy lemon balances the creamy butter quite perfectly, while salt and pepper add just a little punch. And that’s all you need! Really! The trick to making these green beans out-of-this-world good is to not over cook them. The beans should still have quite a bit of “tooth” to the texture, without having that raw flavor. The color should be a bright vibrant green rather than a dull olive color. This is\\xa0how you do vegetables\\xa0right.\\n\\nP.S. The “lemon butter treatment” works well with other vegetables, too. I do the same thing with broccoli fairly often.\\n\\nLemon Butter Green Beans\\n\\n\\n\\nLemon Butter Green Beans (revisited)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTotal Cost: $1.71\\n\\nCost Per Serving: $0.43\\n\\nServes: 4\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\n1 lb. green beans $0.98\\n\\n1 Tbsp butter $0.09\\n\\n1 lemon $0.59\\n\\nSalt and Freshly Cracked Pepper to taste $0.05\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nUse a microplane, zester, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the thin layer of yellow zest from the lemon.

Set the zest aside.\\n\\nSnap the stem ends off of one pound of fresh green beans. If you like smaller pieces, you can also snap each bean in half. Place the beans in a colander and rinse with cool water.\\n\\nAdd the washed green beans to a deep skillet and add about one inch of water. The water should not cover the beans. The water is just there to generate steam. You can use a steaming basket, but I find it unnecessary. The cooking time is so brief that the beans at the bottom that are IN the water don’t seem to cook any more than the beans on top that only get steam.\\n\\nPlace a lid on the skillet and then place it over a medium-high flame. Let the water come to a boil, then let the beans continue to simmer/steam in the skillet for 3-5 minutes, or until they are bright green and just barely tender.\\n\\nTest the texture with a fork. They should be slightly softer than the fresh beans, but still have quite a bit of “tooth” or crunch. You don’t want to over cook them here because they will continue to cook a bit from the residual heat. The color should be bright green. If they’re a dull olive color, they’ve cooked too long.\\xa0\\n\\nDrain the cooked beans in a colander and then return them to the skillet with the heat turned off.

My roommate and I, who spend an inordinate amount of money at the nearby corner store (because it\\'s right there!), tend to suffer through whatever light bulbs they\\'ve got in stock—more often than not they\\'re soft white 60-watt incandescents. I realize I should be embarrassed.\\n\\nBut in our living room, where there are four to five lamps lighting a space barely larger than a dog house, these hazy bulbs create a warm, layered blanket of light that we love in the evenings. In the kitchen, however, where we try to use them in lieu of our fluorescent ceiling fixture, they fail—in the kitchen, it turns out, you actually need to be able to see.\\n\\nWhat every kitchen needs, as much as a sharp knife or a mixing bowl, is great light. Of course a great big window, where perfectly clear natural light filters in during the day, helps quite a bit—but cooking dinner (save for a few steps), is an evening task. And as much as I\\'d like to report that you can light a whole kitchen with vintage-inspired, sepia-toned Einstein bulbs or milky incandescents, you shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nThe lighting experts at Batteries Plus Bulbs—specifically Jori Gohsman, one of their Senior Category Managers—were kind enough to set me straight: Here\\'s what kind of light bulbs are good for your kitchen, and how to get plenty of cozy vibes while still lighting it up right. I won\\'t be offended if you skip to the end for their suggestions, but what follows is how we got there.\\n\\nColor Temperature\\n\\nThe first thing you need to know is that Kelvin is actually more important than wattage when it comes to selecting a light bulb; that\\'s what will tell you the color temperature of your bulb on a spectrum of cool (indicated by a higher Kelvin) to warm (lower Kelvin).\\n\\nCooler bulbs are easier to see by, so that\\'s what you want to rely on in the kitchen—whereas warmer bulbs give off that cozy, casual vibe that makes lounges and restaurants so inviting. Besides affecting visibility, the color of a bulb can also change the dynamic of a space just as any other element of decor can.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are the different options you can shop for, starting with the most kitchen-friendly:\\n\\nDaylight (5000K): With a white, almost bluish light, daylight bulbs are meant to \"resemble noon on a cloudless day\" (I\\'m thinking this is what my fluorescents must be). Rather than using them everywhere in a kitchen, spring for them as accents where you do food prep or read recipes, for example. (Reading, Jori tells me, has actually been proven to be easier under daylight bulbs than any other.) Style-wise, they\\'ll make cool-colored decorations pop but will muddy any orangey decor.\\n\\nCool White (4100K): A great workhorse bulb for your kitchen and bathrooms (or for any room where the decor is blue or green rather than reddish in color), cool whites are crisp without feeling overly so.\\n\\nAnd on the other end of the spectrum, best for rooms where knife work isn\\'t required, are the warmer options:\\n\\nSoft White (2700 to 3000K): This is what classic incandescents emit: a gentle, yellowish, familiar light that\\'s warmer than a cool white bulb would give off. It will pull out the reds and oranges in your decor, so relegate them to rooms that aren\\'t too blue.\\n\\nWarm White (2400K): The warmest color temperature, warm white bulbs more closely resemble candle light than a bulb at all. They\\'re all ambiance—so they do their best work in the living room, dining room, and bedroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBulb Types\\n\\nI am sure that many of you froze in your seats when I mentioned traditional incandescents, which are known not just for their warmth (2700K) but for being known energy hogs (they put out more heat than light, according to National Geographic!). There are, fortunately, more energy-efficient and longer-lasting alternatives:\\n\\nHalogens, which are available exclusively in a relatively warm 3000K, show 100% true color—something that a jeweler, for instance, might care about, and they\\'re inexpensive. But they\\'re now considered an old technology, and will actually dim as they warm.\\n\\nCFL\\'s, which can be spiral-shaped as in the one pictured below, are basically mini-fluorescents meaning they can require some time to \"warm up.\" But while they can last ten times longer than traditional incandescents (I have one that I haven\\'t changed in three years!) and are available in any color temperature, they contain a small amount of mercury—so if you break one, the extensive cleanup required makes them less than convenient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLEDs, which initially were known for their higher price point, have the lowest energy cost and are available in increasingly affordable and flexible technology. You can choose from directional, semi-directional, or omni-directional styles—the latter being the most diffused, best for lamps, and directional being best for spotlighting—and almost any color temperature. New warm LEDs (around 2400K) would be great for a chandelier or moodier lighting, and you can even find vintage-inspired Einstein-style versions (2000K), if you\\'re hoping to add (efficient) ambiance to a living room.\\n\\nBut with so many ups and downs to each, the bulb style you choose is a personal (or even political) choice as much as an aesthetic one.\\n\\nAdding Ambiance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo let\\'s say you\\'re outfitting a kitchen with cool white light (via fluorescents, CFLs, or LEDs), which will give you good visibility throughout the space. You might add in a few daylight bulbs, by way of directional LEDs perhaps, to brighten your work stations.\\n\\nBut what if sometimes, you want to be able to set the mood in your kitchen ?\\n\\nI asked Jori if layering decorative bulbs, with their warm amber glow, in space that\\'s already outfitted with cool whites and daylights (like a kitchen) would ever be a good idea. \"You can get away with having both,\" she said—and I cheered!—but recommended instead installing a dimmer for more control over brightness, or even opting for color-changing LEDs so you can control the temperature (as you dim them, they\\'ll cool all the way from 3,000 to 2,200 Kelvin).\\n\\nSo the tiny lamp with a soft white bulb in my kitchen, which emits a soothing yellow light we simply cannot see by? It can stay! Because it\\'s nice when we\\'re not using the kitchen as a kitchen. But as soon as I start cooking, it goes off and the overhead goes on—because I like the idea of keeping all my fingers intact.\\n\\nTags:\\nlight, light bulbs, lighting, kitchen lighting\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'This weekend is all about getting ready for summertime fun with easy meal-prep ideas from The Pioneer Woman, potluck recipes from Nancy Fuller and picnic ideas from the co-hosts of The Kitchen.

In the past there has been some horse trading between null sec groups to support a common front.\\xa0 Not so much this year I guess.\\n\\nOf course, as with the full slate of candidates, I can barely tell you anything about people on that ballot.\\xa0 Aryth is in GSF leadership, Innominate is the new Solo Drakban, Tora Bushido runs the Marmites, who used to take Gevlon’s money to shoot us in high sec before breaking with him, Annexe is in my alliance, and I follow Chiimera on Twitter, but I thought he stopped playing EVE at one point.\\n\\nNot a very helpful set of descriptions.\\n\\nAnd then there is Xenuria.\\n\\nHe might be the candidate I know the most about.\\n\\nHe ran last year and, if I recall right, managed 18th place which, given the rate of removal for CSM X, put him in contention to be a replacement member before the end.\\xa0 He got that much following without an alliance endorsement.\\xa0 This year he has the number 3 spot on the GSF ballot.\\n\\nOf course, that doesn’t make some people happy.\\xa0 A year ago Xenuria was an object of ridicule in many parts of the coalition, and the punchline for any joke requiring the most unlikely individual for most of us.\\xa0 And then he appeared on the Meta Show with The Mittani back in August and seemed pretty reasonable.

There\\'s the poor planetary production booster Avatar-278, for instance, a sentient harvesting unit who sells his services following a purge of AI-powered machines on his home planet. In my darkest hour, I enlisted the expensive aid of Ruire Podaq Nu and her Swayer-11 ship, a Precursor constructor vessel that alters the allegiance of non-capital planets within its range. Who says love\\'s the only force that can turn enemies into friends? \\n\\nOverpowered? Almost certainly, and ships like Ms. Nu\\'s can disrupt a match so thoroughly I\\'m surprised there\\'s no way to disable the Bazaar in custom matches. But it\\'s a controlled chaos, at least, held in check partly by the fact that each faction has access to the same catalog of mercs, which randomly selects an assortment of 36 for each match from a total pool of 70. Though whatever I buy stays mine for the duration of the match, so there\\'s no worry that multiple Ms. Nus will flutter about the unfriendly nebulae. \\n\\nMercenaries are best used to make a massive leap in progress (and they thus sometimes only serve to make the powerful more powerful) or to gain a significant advantage when in a tight spot. That sometimes meant I didn\\'t need them at all when my strategy was unfolding well, and the AI would seem to agree, as it uses mercenaries sparingly at best. Their prohibitive costs make most mercenary ships a gamble, particularly since they don\\'t upgrade throughout the game and their specific natures all but broadcast your victory strategy to your opponents. At times I did fine upgrading my ships without tossing my money toward hired help; but in others, I was happy to pay the cost for the boosts to production or firepower a mercenary could bring. They\\'re thus a generally welcome expansion of the choices available, as they yield some hope in spots where the base game would have let you waste away into defeat.\\n\\nI doubt the idea that a bunch of ruffians would hire out their services for some cash requires great leaps of the imagination, but a new campaign provides a reason for the mercs\\' existence should you need one. Yet \"campaign\" is such a strong word. It\\'s a bit longer than many individual chapters of the main campaign and it fleshes out the lore for the two reintroduced races from the series\\' past, but it\\'s essentially a elaborate tutorial for the Bazaar in fancy digs.\\n\\nSuch as it is, the campaign follows the plight of the Torians, a race of what looks like shell-less turtles who can colonize aquatic worlds without penalty. For years they\\'ve been slaves to the orcs-but-not-orcs of the Drengin Empire. Since the Drengin are occupied elsewhere in the wake of the main campaign\\'s conclusion, they\\'re trying to rebuild their own empire. The Arcean Empire also makes an appearance, thus allowing a warrior race for players who don\\'t feel like playing evil space orcs. It\\'s decent stuff, but ultimately skippable for those who\\'d rather stick to the random maps.\\n\\nAs our proven mercenary hater might ask, does the end justify the means? Considering that Mercenaries costs half as much as Galactic Civilizations III itself, I suppose that depends on whether tossing away 20 bucks counts as living beyond your means. The mercenaries and two new races certainly enrich the existing 4x sandbox, but there\\'s not much else aside from numerous tweaks hidden under the hood. \\n\\nYet as I learned when I cashed in all my credits to enlist the services of Enopriumta Xu\\'s fearsome dreadnought to score a last-minute victory, sometimes it\\'s worth slapping down a bit of extra cash for an edge.\\xa0\\n', \"Microsoft has a flurry of new Xbox One features on the way in its next console update, headlined by an increase in Party Chat size from 12 up to 16.\\n\\nThis larger number will apply to Parties either on Xbox One or on Windows 10 via the Xbox app. You'll also be able to include your Party chat with your Twitch broadcasts. \\n\\nBackwards-compatible Xbox 360 games will now be listed on the Xbox One store, and achievements will now appear in your feed.\\n\\nSpeaking of Achievements, there's now a dedicated section for them in the console's menu sidebar.

That might be why a recent demo of a new glasses-free 3D TV from Ultra-D blew me away. It\\xa0just works.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nAs the \"wow factor\" wanes, do gamers care about 3D anymore?\\n\\nSix years or so after the industry declared that stereoscopic 3D displays were going to be the future of entertainment, 3D TVs are decidedly not the present of entertainment. A combination of relatively\\xa0wonky glasses technology, high costs, and a general lack of interesting content have turned what was once a hot ticket into an overwhelming market flop, save for a few holdout TV set makers and aging devices like Nintendo\\'s 3DS line.\\n\\nAt least one company thinks it\\xa0finally has\\xa0the right combination of technology and timing to give traditional 2D displays some added depth, though. After years of quiet development, StreamTV Networks has started manufacturing displays with its Ultra-D technology—displays that don\\'t require glasses, focal \"sweet spots,\" or much in the way of specially made 3D content. After seeing the technology on display at DICE recently, I found myself less-than-skeptical about stereoscopic TVs for quite possibly the first time ever.\\n\\nIf you happen to glance at an Ultra-D TV without being prompted, it can take your brain a second or two to figure out what exactly is different about the image you\\'re seeing. The 3D effect is a bit subtle, with less apparent depth than most other stereoscopic systems (or the very convincing depth effect on a virtual reality headset). Still, there\\'s a distinct layering\\xa0to the image that draws your attention immediately, and it helps focus that attention to the foreground action and away from the blurry background.\\n\\nThe 3D image on the Ultra-D screen is much crisper than most other stereoscopic systems I\\'ve seen, without any of the frame rate, resolution, or brightness compromises that are common to other 3D solutions. Ultra-D uses a proprietary glass-cutting and gluing process to create a series of \"overlapping microviews.\" That means the 3D effect is solid anywhere within a 140 degree viewing area, without the need for special glasses or dithering parallax barriers to separate out different images for each eye.\\n\\n\"We bend the light through the glass, so there\\'s no right or left alternating image,\" StreamTV Networks Software Engineer Dusten Sobotta told Ars. \"You don\\'t need two\\xa0cameras or any of that... all of the traditional stereoscopic thought process doesn\\'t apply here.\"\\n\\n\"Mechanically, the glass doesn\\'t change, but there\\'s an algorithm being run on the input image that scatters it, rearranging the pixels knowing what the glass arrangement does to those pixels,\" he continued. \"Given an input image and depth [data], the lens scatters the light, almost into a field, such that your eyes looking at a single point in space will see two different things.\"\\n\\nUp-dimensioning 2D content\\n\\nIn the past, 3D technology has always had the\\xa0chicken-and-egg problem of generating\\xa0enough specially made 3D content for the displays to appeal to a\\xa0critical mass. The Ultra-D system gets around that limitation somewhat by using an embedded Qualcomm chip and an algorithm the company says can add apparent depth to any 2D content. Sobotta told us the chip samples 2D images in near real-time over a few frames, using a combination of parallax and edge-detection algorithms (and some secret \"special sauce\") to figure out the appropriate depth for each pixel on the 4K display. The effect is certainly convincing if the upconverted 2D-to-3D movie trailers being shown in the DICE demo room are any indication.\\n\\n An exploded view of the tech inside an Ultra-D display.\\n\\nFor gaming, this multi-frame sampling process would create an unacceptably noticeable lag of about 30 milliseconds, according to the Ultra-D representatives. But developers can get past that issue using an SDK that makes it easy to pass in-game depth data in a form the TV can immediately interpret, with no lag. Nvyve Studios Director Adam Simonar, who was on hand to show off \"utopian survival horror\" game Pamela with Ultra-D integration, said the SDK took just a few hours to fully integrate with the Unity graphics pipeline and a week to fine tune.\\n\\n\"The general vibe everyone gets when they hear \\'SDK\\' now, since the Oculus has been so huge, is that it will take six months to a year of development time, some crazy undertaking,\" StreamTV Networks\\' Games Director Zach Lehman told Ars. \"Everyone is under the belief that it\\'s a massive undertaking. They simply don\\'t believe us. It makes a big difference when developers [like Simonar] can tell people.\"\\n\\nAside from programming time, developers might also be worried that adding stereoscopic support will\\xa0come with a significant performance hit. In the past, stereoscopic games often had to lower resolutions or remove\\xa0graphical details in order to render a distinct view for each eye or to avoid hitting bandwidth caps on the GPU or even the HDMI cable itself. But Sobotta says the Ultra-D SDK doesn\\'t require any noticeable performance compromises—just send a bit of\\xa0depth data along with the full-resolution 2D image, and the display handles the rest instantly.\\n\\nDespite these improvements to the underlying technology, convincing game developers to take another swing at stereoscopic 3D all these years later can still be an uphill battle. Lehman says his company has\\xa0been making steady progress convincing the development community to take the plunge, though; he\\xa0said Wargaming, Ubisoft, and EA had all shown interest, but he didn\\'t provide much in the way of details.\\n\\n\"The worst part is that the only thing left is the bitter taste in the mouths of all the people that have tried [stereoscopic game development] before,\" Lehman said. \"Developers say, \\'We tried 3D a long time ago and it sucked and we hated it and we don\\'t even want to talk to you.\\' That one\\'s pretty easy to pass because we can just buy their eyes... as soon as they see it, that hurdle is overcome 100% of the time.\"\\n\\nAfter years in quiet development, StreamTV Networks says it\\'s partnering with major TV brands to bring its technology to market this year, though the first sets will probably come from the Chinese manufacturers that bid the most for the still-limited production capacity (\"China loves 3D,\" Lehman said). The total manufacturing cost for the process is only about 10 percent higher than that for a normal 4K display the same size, according to Lehman, which should limit the retail premium for\\xa0the technology.\\n\\nAfter rolling out 65-inch and 50-inch displays this year, Lehman said the same basic process could be adapted for smaller computer monitors or even cell phone screens down the line. Frankly, that can\\'t come soon enough. I\\'ve never been that excited about other stereoscopic screens, but ever since my brief demo with Ultra-D technology,\\xa0every time I\\xa0look at a normal 2D display, it looks depressingly... flat.\\n', 'It\\'s not just Rocket League that\\'s getting DLC based on the upcoming Warner Bros. movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

And you\\'re given\\xa0so much space to work with that it\\'s easy to dream of a sprawling field of crops and livestock, all designed however you think is right.\\xa0Unfortunately, that sprawling landscape means you\\'ll typically never see your entire farm on screen at once. And honestly, what\\'s the point of spending hours grooming your digital homestead if you can\\'t show it off to anybody?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tWell\\xa0I\\'m happy to say that we\\'ve found a way to take full resolution screenshots of your entire farmland relatively easily, with the simple use of\\xa0Durante\\'s GeDoSaTo tool. Our hardware editor Wes Fenlon has written about\\xa0the wonders of GeDoSaTo before, and we\\xa0frequently use it to take high-resolution screenshots for our\\xa0Pixel Boost series, but it has a slightly unique effect on\\xa0Stardew Valley.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tGeDoSaTo allows you to run games at extremely high resolutions, and then downsample them to work on your monitor. But Stardew Valley\\'s camera scales with your resolution—meaning the higher the resolution is set, the more zoomed out you will be. Read on to find out exactly how you can crank Stardew Valley\\'s resolution up to 8K, making your entire farm visible on any resolution monitor, and then take full-res screenshots of it.\\xa0\\n\\nSetting up\\xa0GeDoSaTo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe first step is to\\xa0download and install GeDoSaTo.\\xa0Make sure you follow the installation\\xa0instructions on that page, and don\\'t worry, it\\'s all\\xa0safe. We trust Durante so much\\xa0we often have him write for us.\\n\\nWhitelist Stardew Valley\\n\\n\\n\\tOnce it\\'s installed, you\\'ll need to adjust a few settings, but GeDoSaTo makes that pretty simple. Open GeDoSaTo and click the \"Whitelist\" button on the right. Scroll down to the end of the list, start a new line,\\xa0and then\\xa0type \"Stardew Valley\" exactly like that but without the quatation marks. Hit the \"Save\" button at the bottom and then the \"Close\" button. This will give GeDoSaTo permission to change the game\\'s resolution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurn on\\xa0screenshots\\n\\n\\n\\tNext, click the \"Edit Keybindings\" button. Near the top of the file, you should see a line that says \"#takeFullScreenshot VK_DIVIDE\". All you have you to do is delete the \"#\" at the start of that line. This will make it so pressing the division key on your numpad (which looks like a forward slash, usually) while in game takes a screenshot the size of whatever resolution the game is running at.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tIf you don\\'t have a numpad or want to rebind the key, feel free to do so by replacing \"VK_DIVIDE\" with something else. Instead of looking up the proper format for each key, it\\'s probably easiest to choose one of the function keys, which would be done by using \"VK_F1\", \"VK_F2\", and so on through \"VK_F12\" depending on which key you want to use (again, without the quotation marks).\\n\\n\\n\\tNow hit the \"Save\" button and the \"Close\" button\\xa0again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFix the mouse\\n\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re almost ready, but right now the mouse won\\'t work on part of the screen when you bump the game to higher resolutions. To fix this, click the \"Edit Settings\" button. First, while we are in this menu, make sure there is a line in the \"Graphics settings\" section near the top\\xa0that reads \"renderResolution 7680x4320@60\" and that there isn\\'t a \"#\" before it. It should be there by default. If not, add it with the other \"renderResolution\" lines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThen,\\xa0scroll almost all the way to the bottom—the second to last section should be called \"Mouse settings\". Near the top of this section, you should see the two lines \"modifyGetCursorPos false\" and\\xa0\"modifySetCursorPos false\". For both lines, delete \"false\" and write \"true\" (without the quotation marks).\\xa0Once again,\\xa0hit the \"Save\" button and then then \"Close\" button.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow make sure the \"Activate\" button is greyed out (click it, if not) and you are ready to go!\\n\\nRunning Stardew Valley\\n\\n\\n\\tThis is the easy part. First, just to be safe, you can choose to back-up your save file.\\xa0There really isn\\'t any risk of something going wrong here, but it\\'s never a bad idea to safe rather than sorry. You can find your save data in \"C:\\\\Users\\\\[YOUR PC\\xa0USERNAME]\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\StardewValley\\\\Saves\", just make a copy of your character\\'s folder, because why not?\\n\\nA quick note\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tFor the\\xa0two drop-down menus for \"Window Mode\" and \"Resolution\", you\\'ll need to hold the mouse button down, hover over your choice, and then let go. And oddly, the game would always put me in windowed mode the first time I selected fullscreen, but then would\\xa0actually go into fullscreen the second time. Who knows why, but it may\\xa0work that way.\\n\\t\\n\\nIncrease the resolution\\n\\n\\n\\tNow let\\'s get to the good stuff!\\xa0Simply start Stardew Valley and load into the game you want to take a screenshot of. Once in game, hit escape and go to the \"Options\" tab. Scroll down to the Graphics section\\xa0and put the game into \"Fullscreen\". Then click resolution and scroll all the way down to \"7680x4320\". 8K resolution, baby.\\xa0If you don\\'t see the higher resolutions in the list, make sure you\\'ve set up GeDoSaTo properly and that the program is activated.\\n\\n\\n\\tYou should now be running the game downsampled from 8K, which you will notice by the immense amount of black space around the now tiny settings window. Hit escape to close the menu and step outside to behold the wonder that is your entire farm!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTake a screenshot\\n\\n\\n\\tAt this point, you should just be able to hit the division key on your numpad (or whatever you set it to) and see a little message in the top-left corner of the screen from GeDoSaTo saying it had saved the image. The default path for where the images will save is \"C:\\\\GeDoSaTo\\\\screens\\\\Stardew Valley\", so make sure it is there and that the resolution is\\xa07680x4320. If so, congratulations! Now go show your farm off to the world.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\tOtherwise, there may be trouble in the water. I occasionally got a message that said\\xa0\"Failed taking screenshot! (STBI)\" and wasn\\'t sure what it meant, but it prevented me from saving screenshots at all. The problem seemed sporadic, but I managed to sort of\\xa0fix it by going back into GeDoSaTo\\'s Settings file, scrolling to the very bottom, and changing the number after \"maxScreenshotParallelism\" then saving the file. I tried pretty much all the\\xa0numbers between -1 and 4, but they all had mixed results. \"0\" (without the quotation marks) seemed to work well sometimes but not always. It could occasionally be jostled into working by stepping from one screen to another within the game.\\n\\n\\xa0\"-1\" worked the most consistently for me, but it also took way longer to take the screenshots and the files were saved as BMPs instead of PNGs, so they are\\xa0huge and hard to use.\\xa0I\\'ve reached out to Durante to for his thoughts on the issue.\\n\\nBrag to the world\\n\\nStrangely enough, you can actually play the whole game like this, with\\xa0most of the map\\'s entirely visible on your screen at once. Though I don\\'t imagine it\\'s a great way to be precise. \\n\\n\\n\\tI hope this guide was helpful, and let us know in the comments below if you got it to work or ran into trouble. We will admire your farm or try to help, respectively.\\xa0Also, get those farms looking good, because soon we\\'ll be asking for you to submit the coolest looking one\\'s you\\'ve made for a community gallery on the site.\\n', '\\n\\nMonster Hunter X has finally been announced for North America with Monster Hunter Generations for 3DS.

Its developer\\xa0announced on the game\\'s Facebook page that it would cease production \"for reasons beyond our control.\"\\n\\nThe developer declined to elaborate further. Just last month,\\xa0a short video on the Shadow Moses Facebook page hinted that a \"huge announcement\" would be coming on March 14.\\n\\nThe Shadow Moses team revealed the high-definition remake of Metal Gear Solid in October 2015. The gaming community caught wind of the project when the developer\\xa0released a teaser trailer in January, showing off iconic locations from the 1998 PlayStation game.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nAfter the video racked up more than 100,000 views, lead developer Airam Hernandez clarified on Facebook that Konami owns the rights to the Metal Gear Solid franchise and thus Shadow Moses would require the company\\'s blessing \"sooner or later.\"\\n\\nWhether Konami is behind Shadow Moses\\' sudden cancelation is not yet known. We\\'ve reached out to both the Shadow Moses team and Konami for comment and will update when we receive it.\\n', '\\n', \"We’re Butterscotch Shenanigans, a three-brother indie studio based out of St. Louis, home of a low cost-of-living and the vibrant St. Louis Game Dev Co-op.\\n\\nWe use GameMaker: Studio and Inkscape to make games so fast that we have to constantly cover our faces with Neosporin to treat the windburn.We’ve been around since the last breaths of 2012 when we left our jobs with nothing but some savings and some dreams of making it in the games industry.\\n\\nLeading up to the launch of Crashlands, our first foray into the PC games market, we’d launched four titles on mobile, garnering around 4.5 million players between them. The average time for the production of those four titles was < 49 work days.\\n\\n\\n\\nCrashlands was meant to be our mic drop, the thing that would put us on the path to being a sustainable indie studio. It’s a crafting-ARPG that brings together aspects of all our favorite games, culminating in 40+ hours of story-driven content spanning a massive procedural world.\\n\\nIt took much longer than our previous projects to make (2 years in full), and released on January 21st simultaneously across Steam, iTunes, Google Play, and Humble, along with a service that lets players play the same save across all platforms.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nCrashlands got some love from the storefronts, including a Steam pop-up ad and the iPad “Editor’s Choice” banner on iTunes. During launch, the only game ahead of us on the mobile paid charts was Minecraft, and Crashlands now ranks among the best games on iOS according to Metacritic. (Its PC Metascore is much lower, clocking in at a salty 77, despite a 93% rating on Steam from users. We’ll come back to that later.)\\n\\nCrashlands has been successful enough for us to begin making plans to grow the studio, and to continue making games for at least a few more years. But being successful enough certainly doesn’t mean we did it all right. Not even close.\\n\\nThis article recounts what we think were the good and bad decisions we made over Crashlands’ two years of development.\\n\\nWhat went wrong\\n\\n1) Inception, or:\\xa0Let's compete with Don't Starve!\\n\\nMost companies won’t want to say they got it wrong at the start, but it’s safe to say on some level that we did. The design of Crashlands and its goal for us as a studio was to create a huge, open-world adventure that came with a massive pile of content and tons of story, driven by crafting and combining our favorite elements from greats like Diablo, Pokemon, and Terraria.\\n\\nThe initial spark was caused by some serious life events; it wasn’t driven by any market research, but by the need to create something big and meaningful to us as people.\\n\\nA very, very early screenshot. Good GOD this game was ugly.\\n\\nThis isn’t inherently a bad thing, as the game did that job well and was exactly what we needed it to be. But from a business perspective,\\xa0we screwed up.\\n\\nThe market reality is that we made a cartoony, crafting-centered game that has the same visual perspective as Klei’s wildly successful, cartoony, and crafting-heavy game Don’t Starve. While it’s true that anyone who plays both games will tell you there are more differences than similarities, that’s irrelevant when people don’t want to try out our “clone” in the first place!\\n\\nThe Lesson:\\xa0We didn’t manage to hit one of the most important rules for indie game development - Don’t Compete!\\xa0Our next title will be designed at the outset to be as different from existing games as we can manage. While there is phenomenal merit in attempting to expand a genre, the byline of “It’s kinda like X, but we pinky-swear it’s not just a clone!” doesn’t work as well as offering something unambiguously unique -- especially if everyone is already happy with X.\\n\\n2) Platform Bias, or:\\xa0Mobile is a dirty word\\n\\nThe difference between the mobile and PC markets is staggering. Not in size, market cap, or the type of gamer that thrives in either, but in their perception of one another.\\n\\nBecause Crashlands was designed to be as similar as possible on mobile and PC, many PC reviewers and prospective players presumed that the title must have had to sacrifice both form and function to fit on mobile (“it’s just a port of a crappy mobile game!” they yell, knowing nothing about it except that it exists on mobile).\\n\\nSome reviewers seemed determined to dislike the game, and took the opportunity to blame features they didn’t like as being mobile concessions. We severely overestimated our ability to overcome this bias with our own messaging.\\n\\nAn early view of the worldmap, generated with Perlin Noise.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lesson: Be aware of how your audience will perceive your game and work with, or around it, rather than in opposition to it. In our case, this may mean launching our next title on Steam first, then on mobile.\\n\\n3) PC Localization, or: When in Rome\\n\\nOne thing that completely caught us off guard with the PC launch was the number and intensity of requests for options to adjust every aspect of the game. We designed the game around its control scheme, and around many of the other options that PC gamers wanted to change. We believed (and still believe) that different control schemes would lead to a worse gameplay experience, so why even make that an option?\\n\\nOf course, the absence of controller and WASD control schemes were not taken as signs that the game was designed to be played a certain way; their absence was instead taken as evidence that Crashlands is just a bad PC port of a mobile game.\\n\\nThe terrain was reformed halfway through dev to be less blocky and hideous.\\n\\nThe Lesson: In future games, we’ll be adding as many control schemes and other options as we can, from the start. Even if we think the additional schemes aren’t as good. The presence of options are important to people, more so than the value of the options themselves. It is important to “localize” the game for every platform in order to make sure players feel like it truly belongs there.\\n\\n4) Embargo Break, or: OH GOD EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE\\n\\nWe handle all of our own PR and outreach. Crashlands was the first time we got to work with youtubers, and overall it was a lovely experience. After speaking with some of them individually we discovered that they’re frequently overworked and really appreciate having extra time to review and develop a series before it launches. With this in mind, we bumped our press release date up from 4 days prior to launch to 14, which was met with a lot of praise and gratitude from the youtubers we hoped would cover Crashlands.\\n\\nHowever, 5 days after we sent out the Steam codes (to over 600 people) a Let’s Play was accidentally posted by a prominent Youtuber.\\n\\nThis was simultaneously great and terrible news. It was great because we had no mindshare in the youtube space, so getting one youtuber on board felt like we might make something of it. It was terrible because launch was 9 days away, which from all our reading was WAY TOO DAMN FAR for coverage to start flowing.\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nWhen we couldn’t get ahold of the youtuber and found out he’d left for vacation the day of posting (and had scheduled a series of episodes to auto-publish daily), we freaked out a bit. Given that we didn’t know how this would affect the launch we wanted to sit on it and see what happened. A day later we started getting angry notes from other youtubers, some big and some small, who were upset that we’d given exclusive access to the embargo breaker (which we hadn’t). They were threatening to not cover the game at all in response to this perceived injustice.\\n\\nThis, too, was simultaneously great and terrible. Great because we were beyond pleased to have one youtuber cover the game, so to have a dozen knocking at the door felt amazing! But terrible because our potential relationship with them was damaged from the start. After working on a game for 2 years, success-threatening events like this can REALLY get your blood pumping.\\n\\nWe resolved this by sending out an emergency email to life the Let’s Play / Preview Embargo immediately, which seemed the only safe move.\\n\\nThe Lesson: Hold your press announcements (with game keys) for at most 10 days before launch, and make the embargo language big, bold, and prominent in the email. Most reviewers/youtubers open an email, grab the key, and go, so they need to be able to see the embargo dates without scrolling or anything.\\n\\n5) Channel Overload, or: WE'RE DROWNING MAKE IT STOP\\n\\nOnce the game launched we were receiving a flood of support, bug, press, and fan contact through a dozen different channels: Forums, Steam Forums, Reddit (3 different subreddits), Twitter, Facebook, our contact form, our support form, and each of our individual emails. It was a lot of communication for any individual channel, let alone multiplied across all of them. Suddenly our lives were consumed with simultaneously fixing bugs, helping users troubleshoot, writing up interview answers, reading and spreading new reviews about, and trying not to die.\\n\\nWe’ve since consolidated all our channels down to a single contact form. How?! By shutting down our Facebook page’s messaging and posting a big ol’ note on Twitter that said that we’re not using it on the regular (temporarily). While we love Twitter it retains no community or cultural memory and so is a bottomless pit of answering the same questions repeatedly. We now use it just to chat and make jokes, which is way better.\\n\\nThe Lesson: Be prepared at launch for an influx of communications with a clear primary channel that delivers the messages to appropriate team members, so you can continue making progress.\\n\\nWhat went right\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s all the bad stuff. At least, that's all\\xa0the bad stuff we didn’t block from memory. The launch actually went incredibly well, and we’re happy with Crashlands’ performance on all the platforms.\\n\\nThat being said, we’re still completely humbled when we look at the launch statistics for other games (Stardew Valley, you glorious beast). We’ve got plenty of work to do going forward.\\n\\nBut here’s the stuff we did well this time around.\\n\\n1) BETA, or: This game is broke as f**k\\n\\nAdam, our back-end/tools developer, is a PhD in molecular biology. He argued for a beta to both uncover bugs and find any weakpoints in the game’s overall design. The rest of the crew was initially hesitant at taking a large chunk of time to do the beta -- We were so close to being done! But Adam’s arguments eventually won out.\\n\\nThe Beta saved Crashlands. The game, in its entirety, has between 40-60 hours of content. While each of us had played it up until launch and found it to be acceptably stable, the Beta showed us how hilariously wrong we were.\\xa0\\n\\nOur 170 or so beta testers submitted over 2,000 bugs, feedback items, and general suggestions over four weeks. 2,000! That’s thousands of bug reports we didn’t have to fret over during launch, and thousands of opportunities to give our players a much better experience.\\n\\nWe also changed many of the game’s systems and did the final balance pass at this time. It honestly took the game from good to great.\\n\\nThe Lesson: Beta test the hell out of your game. It’s not nearly as good or as ready as you think it is.\\n\\n2) Story tools, or: Getting that Jetfuel\\n\\nCrashlands contains an epic narrative that effectively spans those 40-60 hours of content. It’s like a small book -- over 50,000 words of dialogue. And it was written, coded, and edited in just over three months by two people.\\n\\nThis is all because of the Crashlands Creator, the back-end narrative tool that Adam developed. It has a steep learning curve to it, but once we were up to speed with its operation the tool made adding stories almost an equal-time exercise, meaning that one hour of dev time could equal one hour of story time, in some cases. This freed Seth, our games programmer, to continue adding content to the game and fixing bugs up until release, without ever having to touch elements of the narrative structure.\\n\\nIt will also let us turn the creation of additional content over to our community, which will continue to provide value to our players long after we’ve moved on to our next title!\\n\\nThe Lesson: Tools are an understated necessity of gamedev. Take the time to build the right tools to let your whole team take flight.\\n\\n3) Three-way cloud launch, or: All the giants smiled at us\\n\\nSuccess is highly dependent not just on traditional press and Youtubers/streamers, but on the storefronts themselves.\\n\\nLaunching on all 3 platforms simultaneously was a key part of our strategy, as it let us take advantage of Crashlands’ crossplatform saving capability, which lets players play it on their PC/Mac and then continue playing the same save on their Android or iOS device.\\n\\nWhile we had brief contact with each storefront, it was never a given that any of them would listen to us or care about Crashlands’ launch. Come January 21st, each one of them gave us some form of a nod that helped visibility massively: On iTunes, this was Editor’s Choice for the iPad all over the world; on Google Play, an icon in their New Games section; and on Steam, a pop-up ad that lasted through the weekend.\\n\\nNo amount of marketing we could pay for (which, by the way, was zero) would ever have the effect that the buy-in of the platforms got us. The visibility also helped fuel the general hype-fire around the game on other platforms beside the one it was on, which was an added bonus.\\n\\nThe Lesson: Focus PR effort as much on the Platforms you’re launching on as the press you’re seeking coverage from.\\n\\n4) PR Coverage, or: This better be all over everything\\n\\nWe sent thousands of emails (literally) leading up to launch to get traditional press (like Polygon, PC Gamer, RPS, IGN, TouchArcade, Gamezebo, etc.) on board. We also sent thousands of emails to both youtubers and streamers.\\n\\nWe sent so many damn emails.\\n\\nAnd on launch-day we got coverage in a ton of publications. Thanks to the Youtube embargo being broken, we also had tons of streaming and youtuber coverage on launch-day where people were a hefty way through the game.\\n\\nWe even got a bunch of industry and media people tweeting about it!\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWe managed to get the game out in front of tons of people using only our words and a ridiculous amount of work.\\n\\nThe Lesson: If you’re doing PR yourself, be prepared to send an immense amount of email. Most of them will be completely ignored, but you must follow-up at least once (we suggest two or three times) before giving up. Do not be afraid to sell your game and promote your work.\\n\\n5) Commitment, or: Skin in the game\\n\\nWe’re three brothers. Things got really hard a bunch of times during Crashlands’ development, but we’re all committed to one another, Butterscotch, and the project. Without that level of commitment there’s an exceptionally low probability that this game, which from a technical perspective we COULDN’T EVEN MAKE when we first started development, would ever have been finished. That it went on to claim one of the top Metacritic spots on iOS for all of time, and earned itself a good spot in the PC pile as well, is a testament to this commitment.\\n\\nWe intend on keeping that same level of commitment to one another as a cornerstone of Butterscotch going forward, because we’ve seen the power it can bring to both the creative and production sides of game development.\\n\\nThe Lesson: Game dev is really hard. Life is sometimes hard, too. Commit to your project, your team, and your studio. The presence of just one sturdy anchor can make weathering storms possible.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWe’re extremely proud of Crashlands. It marks what we consider the first true success of our studio, will let us continue making games as well as grow, and has earned us a bunch of new fans and followers.\\n\\nBut we know there’s about a thousand things we could do better - and in the future, we will. Watching other games launch since we went live has been truly humbling. We’ve got a lot to learn, and by focusing on our processes, relationships, and the power of the universe we’re creating, we think we can make the next one even better.\\n\\nTo those of you in the gamedev trenches right now - we hope there are some good nuggets of wisdom (or Wiznugs, as we call them) to help you here.

This update is out now for for PC on Windows 10 through Steam and should arrive via the Windows 10 Store soon.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn a blog post, Rise of the Tomb Raider PC developer Nixxes Software said the introduction of DirectX 12 represents a \"massive step forward\" as it relates to unlocking as much CPU power as possible.\\n\\n\"For Rise of the Tomb Raider the largest gain DirectX 12 will give us is the ability to spread our CPU rendering work over all CPU cores, without introducing additional overhead,\" the developer said. \"This is especially important on 8-core CPUs like Intel i7s or many AMD FX processors.\"\\n\\nNixxes studio head Jurjen Katsman further explained how DirectX 12 will help improve overall performance.\\n\\n\"When using DirectX 11, in situations where the game is under heavy load--for example in the larger hubs of the game--the individual cores may not be able to feed a fast GPU like an Nvidia GTX 980 or even Nvidia GTX 970 quick enough,\" he said. \"This means the game may not hit the desired frame rate, requiring you to turn down settings that impact CPU performance. Even though the game can use all your CPU cores, the majority of the DirectX 11 related work is all happening on a single core. With DirectX 12 a lot of the work is spread over many cores, and the framerate of the game will run at can be much higher for the same settings.\"\\n\\nThe slide below provides an overview of how the CPU load is distributed with DirectX 11 and 12. You can also take a look at the images above to compare Rise of the Tomb Raider using DirectX 11 and 12. As you\\'ll see, with DirectX 12, the game is able to reach 60fps on high settings, while DirectX 11 only hits 46fps.\\n\\n \\n\\nAnother way in which Rise of the Tomb Raider benefits from DirectX 12 is through asynchronous compute, which will be available for both the PC and Xbox One versions of the game through a future patch.\\n\\n\"This allows us to re-use GPU power that would otherwise go to waste, and do multiple tasks in parallel,\" Katsman said. \"And there is a never-before-seen level of control over Nvidia SLI and AMD CrossFireX configurations, which means that as a developer we can take full control over those systems and ensure users get a great experience with them.\"\\n\\nFinally, Katsman said Nixxes is planning \"many more optimizations\" for the future, though no specifics were provided. Additionally, the DirectX 12 PC patch is entirely optional. DirectX 11 will continue to deliver the \"most predictable and proven experience.\"\\n\\n \\n', \"It's going back quite a number of years now, but the DS and its dual-screen format helped deliver some intriguing narrative-driven gaming experiences. Fans of interactive storytelling with a grown-up approach may recall three particular DS releases that provided some notably stylised narratives on the portable - Trace Memory, Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Last Window: The Secret of Cape West. The latter two were moody detective-style tales starring former NYPD cop Kyle Hyde.\\n\\nUnfortunately Last Window was the last game that development studio CiNG produced before going bankrupt. Now, however, Arc System Works is publishing a story-based adventure game - Chase: Unsolved Cases Investigation Division – Distant Memories - being led by the director of all three of the aforementioned DS titles: Taisuke Kanasaki. The project also reportedly has other former CiNG staffers on board.\\n\\nAs you can see below it looks set to have a handsome art style and is a detective story at heart; we're not sure whether the character is actually Kyle Hyde, or just someone rather like the moody protagonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn any case this is coming to the Japanese 3DS eShop in the Spring; whether it comes to the West is likely dependent on its success with that initial launch and whether Arc System Works believes there's popular demand for the title in the West.\\n\\nWould you like this one to come to North America and PAL territories?\\n\", '\\n\\nThe writers of\\xa0Rise of the Tomb Raider took a page from Twitter\\'s playbook during the design process: By breaking every character arc, theme, and plot thread into keywords, they created a \"hashtag board\" to track and balance Tomb Raider\\'s story. During a panel at GDC 2016 today, six members of the team discussed the challenges of making a more emotional journey for Lara, detailing that hashtag\\xa0process.\\n\\n\"It allows us to track everything that\\'s happening in the story,\" said John Stafford, lead narrative designer. \"It\\'s a tool for us to start looking at tension, emotional pacing, and jams of ideas. We might see that a scene has ten hashtags and realize that it\\'s going to be a monster of a scene that\\'s going to have a lot of stuff [happening].\"\\n\\nWith every element of the story broken down into easily digestible pieces, the team was able to look at Rise of the Tomb Raider as a whole composition, noticing gaps and imbalances in plot threads and areas where certain themes could be retooled to become stronger.\\n\\nStafford explained how they began to notice that the hashtag board was lacking use of #Dad during the first few hours of the game. Given how crucial Lara\\'s father is to her identity, Stafford says\\xa0this created an imbalance in the narrative that the team needed to address. \"The arc of [Lara] mirroring her father is very important to her motivation,\" Stafford said. \"We were worried people were just going to lose that thread.\"\\n\\nPutting more #Dad back into the story led the team to invent a whole new system. Instead of letting Lara join the 21st century with a mobile phone, they opted to give her a Dictaphone loaded with monologues from her #Dad to bring some fatherly influence back into the story—albeit in an indirect way.\\n\\nThe hashtag board was also a tool used to help weave myths into Lara\\'s journey. Drawing from Slavic folklore, Rise of the Tomb Raider borrows ideas of immortality from the legend of Kitezh, the Slavic version of Atlantis, as well as Koschei the Deathless, a nasty old man who implants his soul into a needle inside of a duck inside of a rabbit inside of a chest buried underneath a tree—which makes perfect sense, really. These\\xa0themes were then set against an overpowering sense of mortality, meant to be driven home by all the gruesome harm that can befall Lara.\\n\\nCentral to Rise of the Tomb Raider\\'s design plan\\xa0was use of\\xa0\"the world as a character,\"\\xa0telling the story as much through the people as the environment itself. Having a list of hashtags for each scene and encounter made tracking narrative goals easier, according to the team,\\xa0allowing them\\xa0to approach problems more aggressively. One early scene required 47 revisions in order to address each of the keywords that were needed to set the tone of the story, explained writer\\xa0Rhianna Pratchett.\\n\\nWhen I caught up with Stafford after the panel, he was enthusiastic about how powerful hashtagging the story is as a tool. The idea is already implemented into the upcoming projects that Crystal Dynamics is working on and being adapted to suit other purposes outside of working with such layered narratives. \"We\\'re going to be using it for a lot of things going forward,\" Stafford said.\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nNearly two years have passed since we featured Epic Games\\' ambitious fort-building action game on the cover of Game Informer, which has been spinning its wheels in closed alpha for quite some time.

My initial reaction to this -- and to Unity\\'s demo of something similar, which you can watch here -- was that it might simply be an attempt to \"wow\" the audiences of the companies\\' respective press conferences, and ride the very obvious \"tidal wave\" of VR enthusiasm that\\'s sweeping through GDC this year.\\n\\nI don\\'t think that\\'s the case after using Unreal Engine this way, and talking to Epic executives Tim Sweeney and Kim Libreri -- as well as Nick Darnell, an Epic tools programmer who gave me my demo at the Epic Games booth -- leads me to believe the company is in earnest about the potential and limitations of this new way of working.\\n\\nThere are two reasons for this. One is simple: In real life, it worked way better than I anticipated. I\\'ll admit I\\'m not a game developer, and I have limited skill when it comes to using game engines, though I have dabbled here and there. That said, I didn\\'t find it difficult to work with Unreal Engine in Oculus, and could easily place objects, change their properties, inspect them, modify them, and move them around. These were fairly basic actions, but they all worked well after a brief adjustment.\\n\\nDiscussing the tech with the company\\'s CTO Kim Libreri made me realize, too, that the tech was inspired by a real need:\\n\\n\"When you\\'re building a 3D experience in VR, the understanding of the space is really important. Nick Donaldson, who\\'s the lead designer on Bullet Train, his life was this: In the goggles, \\'Does that work? Does that look good? Does it feel good?\\' Off, on, off, on, off. Making slight adjustments, just moving things -- making sure that the space felt right for the experience.\\n\\n\"A lot of the reason we did it was not just for a flashy, \\'Hey, look at this cool demo.\\' It really is to make Nick\\'s life easier. He literally is going backward and forwards between his monitor and the VR headset. And now he can actually really design the space.\"\\n\\nGiven all that I\\'ve heard about the vast differences between designing games for VR and for screens, this makes a lot of sense to me; here are two examples from just this week\\'s GDC talks -- from VR vet Jesse\\xa0Schell and a host of devs with roomscale VR experience.\\n\\nWhen you need to make sure your game works from a very different perspective than on a screen, it makes basic sense to edit it in the HMD, so there\\'s no guesswork.\\n\\nAnd CEO Tim Sweeney was up-front about the limitations of the tool when I spoke to him:\\n\\n\"Anything that involves working in the 3D space it\\'s totally usable. You can go in and use it right now. When you get down to using other parts of the user interface, like the materials editor, you run into limitations. The resolution of the headset is low enough that you don\\'t nearly the text density that you get on a monitor that\\'s sitting in front of you on a desk,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s certainly true. But one cool thing is that you can actually move the menus very close to your face, as though they\\'re pieces of paper, in virtual space if you\\'re having trouble reading something, and it\\'s surprisingly helpful.\\n\\n\"Right now, if you\\'re going to do prolonged work outside of 3D, you\\'ll want to take the headset off and do that. But I think we\\'re just one or two generations from that changing completely,\" Sweeney told me. \"At some point, maybe five years from now, that experience becomes purely superior to the desktop, monitor, keyboard, and mouse experience, because the resolution of the VR headset and the ability to track in 3D is so much higher.\"\\n\\nAfter using the earliest version of the technology, I find it hard to disagree; the ability to quickly edit in VR -- and to pin tools panes to the sky while doing so, and grab them when you need them -- is obviously attractive, even if the current limitations are obvious.\\n\\nDuring my demo, Darnell pointed out that, right now, many developers tend to build in the traditional editor and then do extensive walkthroughs of the content in VR. I have a feeling that makes the most sense, as in the end, they\\'re used to using a PC and it offers more flexibility in some ways -- more freedom for multitasking and better resolution. But if Sweeney\\'s predictions are right on, the balance of the workflow will gradually shift toward direct VR editing.\\n\\nThe upshot: I came away from the demo and these conversations convinced that this is, indeed, an earnest attempt to make something usable rather than something meant to just wow a GDC audience on-stage.\\n\\nThe good news is that you can try it immediately if you have an Oculus Rift development kit with Touch controllers; the source for the VR editor is already on Epic\\'s GitHub repository.

At a GDC talk last week, though, Valve Graphics Programmer Alex Vlachos detailed how a number of adaptive quality programming tricks let him run Valve\\'s impressive Aperture Science VR demo passably on a four-year-old Nvidia GTX 680.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nSee if your system is up for the upcoming HTC Vive.\\n\\nThat\\'s especially impressive because VR graphics can often push even high-end graphics cards to their limits. In virtual reality, the graphics hardware has to push two separate views (one for each eye) at a rock-solid 90 frames per second to avoid a nauseating delay between head movement and the view shown on the display. That leaves the graphics card only 11.1 ms per frame to render what can be complex 3D scenes.\\n\\nThe VR environment also means the user can often move the first person \"camera\" (i.e. their head) wherever they want, as fast as they want. Unlike a standard first-person engine, which usually displays the world only at standing or crouching height, a free-roaming VR engine needs to be potentially ready to display any object from any distance and any angle, rendering it quickly at a convincing level of detail. And a VR engine can\\'t just slow to a crawl when scenes get crowded or complicated, either. Remember, dipping below 90 fps can be literally sickening.\\n\\nIn the past, VR engines have dealt with this problem using tricks like reprojection. If a complex scene meant a frame wasn\\'t ready in time, the engine could run a quick transformation on the previous frame, reprojecting the old image to estimate what the scene might look like at a new head position and angle. That gives the engine some time to catch up with itself, but it\\'s an imperfect solution that can lead to juddery images that look out-of-focus (especially if the trick is\\xa0used frequently). Vlachos urged developers only to use this as \"a last resort safety net\" and not to rely on that technique\\xa0unless the game is running on hardware well below the minimum specifications.\\n\\nYou have to learn to adapt\\n\\n By travelling up and down this scale automatically as needed, a VR engine can maximize GPU usage while maintaining a solid 90 frames per second.\\n\\nA better solution, as Vlachos laid out in detail in his GDC talk, is adaptive quality adjustment. This basically means that the system monitors the processing time for each rendered frame, and immediately lowers or raises the quality of the rendering based on how much headroom is available for that scene.\\n\\nIf the user is looking at a relatively plain and detail-free wall, for instance, the engine can temporarily jack up the image quality to take advantage of all the extra available processing time. When looking at the complicated innards of an Aperture robot, though, the engine would need to quickly dial back the quality to maintain that 90 frames per second performance. The goal is to use 70 to 90 percent of the GPU\\'s power at all times while always pushing out frames in that tight 11.1 ms window (though Vlachos says operating within 10 ms is better to leave some GPU resources for the rest of the system).\\n\\nCertain graphical features can\\'t really be comfortably altered using this adaptive method; the user would probably notice if specular reflections or shadows suddenly popped on and off as they moved around in VR. But the engine can comfortably scale its rendering resolution and viewport size slowly up and down without any jarring effects. The level of detail in edge-smoothing features like multisample anti-aliasing\\xa0(MSAA) can also be tweaked on the fly relatively easily.\\n\\n Graphical explanation of two methods that can improve processing time for VR scenes.\\n\\nAt the very far edges of the performance curve, the engine can even pull off some VR-specific graphics tricks to ensure rendered frames are ready on time. Using fixed foveated rendering, for instance, the engine can lower the apparent resolution in a ring around the edge of each eye\\'s circular VR view. Radial density masking similarly skips rendering alternating pixels near the edge of the player\\'s vision, filling them in based on their neighbors instead. These tricks save a lot of processing time—enough for a 10 to 25 percent performance improvement on their own, Vlachos said—while also mirroring our eyes\\' natural tendency to see objects in more detail near the center of our vision.\\n\\nLowering the VR bar\\n\\nWith all this in mind, Vlachos was able to set a number of stairstep quality levels for Valve\\'s Aperture Science demo. At the high end (achievable reliably only on a top-of-the-line GTX 980Ti card), the demo can run at 140 percent of the default resolution and at enhanced 8x MSAA. At the low end, the resolution drops to 65 percent of the default, MSAA scales back to 4x, and Radial Density Masking is turned on.\\n\\nWith those changes, a demo that was originally designed for a GTX 970 can run with a consistent frame rate on a four-year-old GTX 680 (even if details like text are hard to read at the heavily reduced resolutions required). While that doesn\\'t mean Vlachos is comfortable recommending such old hardware as the new \"minimum spec\" for SteamVR, providing room for such a harsh test gives artists more room to manage\\xa0the trade-offs between highly detailed in-game objects and lower rendering\\xa0resolutions. It also automatically improves how good VR games can look on high-end hardware, without the need to spend time writing new shader code or drawing new art assets.\\n\\nRather than hoarding this adaptive quality scaling for its own Source 2 engine, Valve will be making it available as a free Unity Engine rendering plug-in in the next few weeks. The hope is that the indie studios making many of the first VR games will be able to make those games look and perform better instantly without much additional work. Technical details aside,\\xa0it\\'s nice to see Valve doing this kind of\\xa0low-level work to make sure virtual reality games perform as well as possible right out of the gate.\\n', \"Bungie has detailed its Destiny April update, which finally adds new PVE content to the game on 12th April.\\n\\nNew boss Malok.\\n\\nHighlights of the free add-on include a new strike and new Prison of Elders challenges which see you facing Taken enemies.\\n\\nThe game's Light level cap will also be raised up to 335.\\n\\nApril's fresh strike pits you against a new Taken boss, Malok, who is trying to muscle in on the power vacuum left by Oryx.\\n\\nDestiny's new storyline will launch on the Reef - the setting of the Prison of Elders - and once again see the return of fan-favourite characters Variks and Petra.\\n\\nVariks has a line of new quests, while PlayStation players will get some quests from Petra, too.\\n\\nThe largest addition is probably the new Prison of Elders refresh, which will offer a matchmade mode at 260 Light and a harder mode for players at 320 Light (the game's previous level cap) and above. \\n\\nNew gear to earn.\\n\\nFour new Taken bosses will feature, with modifiers changing every week.\\n\\nPlaying through the new update will let you raise up to 320 Light if you're not there already, Bungie said this evening, as it showed off the new content via Twitch. \\n\\nThe 260 Light Prison of Elders will let you open its reward chest as many times as you want (there's no more keys necessary) for random loot.

There's so much wrong with the movie that it's difficult to find moments where Snyder gets things right, but there are a few that tend to revolve around Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman.\\n\\nUltimately, however, Batman v Superman fails to entertain and, perhaps worse, generates a sour aftertaste even before the credits begin to roll.\\n\\nThe premise of Batman v Superman is simple: Bruce Wayne, in a perpetual state of testosterone fueled anger and fear, is on a mission to destroy Superman after seeing him wreak havoc on Metropolis two years prior. Superman has his own qualms with Gotham's Dark Knight and decides that it's his duty to take down the Caped Crusader, including using his position at the Daily Planet to pen scathing editorials.\\n\\nIt's through an accidental meeting at a party hosted by Lex Luthor, CEO of Lexcorp, that the two meet and throw polite quips at one another, each defending their own secret identities.\\n\\nHere's one of the major issues with the movie: both Ben Affleck, who plays Batman, and Henry Cavill, who plays Superman, are atrocious.\\n\\nWhile Cavill can physically pull off being both Superman and Clark Kent, moving back and forth from the role of superhero to the shy, young journalist decently enough, there isn't one charismatic quality about him. Watching Cavill try to outsmart Batman or flirt with Lois Lane, played by Amy Adams, is torturous. It's almost comparable to watching paint dry, except that feels insulting to paint.\\n\\nAffleck, on the other hand, is by far the worst part of the movie. He's stiff and lifeless, appearing almost overburdened by his own existence. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be charming, mysterious and wicked, but Affleck doesn't capture any of that. This is an angst-ridden teenage in a 30-year-old man's body, and that conflicting portrayal kills any momentum the character may have had in the movie.\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Affleck, who plays Batman, and Henry Cavill, who plays Superman, are atrocious.\\n\\nTo quickly compare, while Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy was also portrayed as an extremely serious character, Bale managed to bring a sense of lighthearted humor to the role when needed. There was witty banter and, above all else, a sense of humanity within his Batman.\\n\\nThat doesn't exist with Affleck. Instead, the latter goes from being angry to sullen to hopeless and back to angry again over the span of two and a half hours. After about an hour of watching Affleck cycle through the same three or four emotions, boredom kicks in and any sympathy that may have existed for the character is gone, replaced instead with a strong sense of disdain for poor Bats.\\n\\nIt's through the two incredibly weak performances, however, that two other actors can shine.\\n\\nJesse Eisenberg, while at times obnoxious, delivers a powerful performance as main baddie Lex Luthor. Like other Eisenberg roles, the actor delivers rapid fire dialogue and uses fantastic facial expressions to accentuate the lines he's reciting. In a film like Batman v Superman, where Batman and Superman are sluggish and mechanical, Eisenberg's hopped up, young villain is a welcome breath of fresh air that manages to feel maniacal and comedic all at once.\\n\\nEisenberg also brings a much needed sense of youth to the film. Batman v Superman feels older than it should. The entire movie plays out like an attempt to brand itself as the opposite of a Marvel movie, doing away with playful banter and replacing it with a continuous stream of war-like images and themes.\\n\\nWhen Eisenberg is on screen, however, the movie gains back some of what is lost, and feels less dire for a couple of minutes. There's a sense of life to Eisenberg that only one other actor delivers, and that's Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.\\n\\nIt's not an understatement that Gadot's Wonder Woman is the most exciting aspect of the film. The actress plays the superheroine fantastically, using every aspect of the comic book warrior to her advantage. She's unbelievably strong, fiercely independent and an utter joy to watch whenever she's on screen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she's not on screen for too long, and the lack of her presence in the film affects the entire feature. Instead, audiences are left with watching Batman and Superman stare at one another and deliver some of the worst dialogue ever written.\\n\\n\\n\\nWonder Woman is the most exciting aspect of the film\\n\\nAside from Cavill and Affleck's performances, one of the biggest problems the film encounters is its lack of cohesiveness.\\xa0Without getting into too much detail, Batman v Superman is the springboard for Warner Bros.' Justice League films — and this movie doesn't let you forget that for a second.\\n\\nUnlike Marvel, which used numerous movies and post-credit sequences to introduce its universe of characters, Snyder uses this one film to try and catch up. In the process, the Batman v Superman loses its momentum, dragging your attention from one story to the next without much warning or explanation. It's disorienting and unmemorable, leaving one to question why certain arcs were included in the first place.\\n\\nSnyder uses other storytelling techniques, like flashbacks and dream sequences, that not only manage to fall flat in the film, but are also pretty confusing at times. It feels like the director is so focused on nailing the visual effects of the film and the fight choreography that the narrative aspect is completely ignored, used only as a way to allow for more explosions and destruction on screen.\\n\\nIt's difficult to understand what Batman v Superman is trying to be, because Snyder — it seems — doesn't know what the movie should be, or how to go about creating the film he envisioned in his head. The majority of the time spent watching this movie is trying to figure out where Snyder wants to go next and wobbling alongside the characters on screen as they move from scene to scene.\\n\\nIt's a visually stunning, disappointing disaster that's bursting at the seams with a promise that's never fully realized. It barely scratches the surface of mediocre.\\n\\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is proof, yet again, that Snyder is a visionary craftsman that can't helm a story. There's too much wrong with the movie for it to be saved, even by strong performances from Gadot and Eisenberg. Even worse, a movie that's two and a half hours long should have enough excitement interjected throughout to carry the audience's attention, but that doesn't happen. Instead, I found myself restless and checking the time every five minutes hoping the movie would just end.\\n\\nWatching Batman v Superman isn't a painful experience, but it's not a pleasant one. It's just one disappointment after the next, and that sour aftertaste I mentioned before?\\n\\nThat's still there.\\n\", '\\nSwedish developer Might and Delight have revealed a new trailer for the soon to be released Shelter 2 spinoff game Paws. This standalone adventure platformer promises to be about the power of friendship and finding the strength to overcome overwhelming odds.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n(Note: Trailer says \"Out Now\", though the game is not releasing until March 24th)\\n\\nThe new trailer shows off more of what to expect in the game, as well as highlighting the wonderful aesthetic of the Shelter series. Playing as the baby lynx, the game should allow players to explore and navigate their way through a rich, atmospheric world. In addition, there will be a new track sensing ability for players to use as they try to return the young lynx to their family.\\n\\nReleasing on March 24th, there will also be an expanded edition of the game called the Pitter Patter Edition. This will feature the original soundtrack created by the award winning Retro Family and Might and Delight\\'s first major attempt at an interactive book, The Lonesome Fog.\\n\\n\\nPaws still looks and sounds wonderful on all fronts, and I believe anybody who has enjoyed the Shelter games is going to want to give this one a serious look when it comes out. Might and Delight have created a very special universe with these games, and the opportunity to experience the setting in a new way should be worthwhile.\\n', \"If there's one thing you can rely on DICE for, it's superb post-release support. It's what helped the hobbled Battlefield 4 back on its feet, pushing it towards greater strides that eventually saw it become one of the finest multiplayer shooters available on console (that single-player campaign, of course, was always going to be well beyond repair), and it's what's kept me sticking around with Battlefront, the slick Star Wars tie-in that was perhaps a little too streamlined upon its launch late last year. \\n\\nWhat's changed since then? The fundamentals are still the same - this remains a stripped-back shooter, aiming for arcade simplicity over more complex thrills, but it's been bolstered by some fine-tuning and a couple of generous expansions, dishing out the superb 40-player mode Turning Point and a handful of maps gratis, including the wonderfully intricate, heart-stoppingly beautiful full-scale effort Survivors on Endor. \\n\\nThere's been a consistent trickle of new things to do, and while it's probably not enough to win back any put off by the relative shallowness of this particular brand of Battlefront, the spectacle it offers hasn't dimmed in the slightest; it's only become that little bit broader. The first significant DLC as part of Star Wars Battlefront, however, doesn't add that much for those who've bought the season pass. After some of DICE's generosity shown elsewhere, it can feel like something of a disappointment. \\n\\nHutt's Contracts are a welcome new way to unlock weapons and cards - elsewhere, Battlefront seems less stingy with credits than before.\\n\\nWhat do you get with the Outer Rim DLC? Essentially it's four new maps, a new game mode and a smattering of new items - some of which have been made free to other players of vanilla Battlefront, some of them exclusive to the DLC owners. First those maps, then, and first the biggest disappointment of it all - they're all mid-sized offerings for 16 players, completely forgoing the 40 player skirmishes that many believe show Battlefront at its best.\\n\\nI'm not wholly convinced that's the case, and Battlefront's lighter touch scales down well, as evidenced in the all-new Extraction mode where one team looks to activate and escort cargo across the map, while the other works to stop them in their tracks. It's a chaos of a very different order than that seen in modes such as Walker Assault and Supremacy, with aggressive choke points on the new maps resulting in breathtaking clashes painted in dazzling sparks and laser fire. \\n\\nWhat a stunning looking game Battlefront can be, and the Outer Rim maps are no exception. The Sorosuub Refinery, a factory full of tricky corridors and a fiery central area, looks resplendent in its red-hot light. Elsewhere, Jabba's Palace is full of the detail that makes Battlefront sing: head down to the basement and you can see the recently felled Rancor, while upstairs Jabba's throne has been captured perfectly. Yet again, Battlefront proves it's absolutely exemplary as a piece of Star Wars merchandise, and as an endearingly obsessive snapshot of this much-loved universe.\\n\\nA shame, then, that all-new environments haven't found their way into the first pack - for that, we'll have to wait for the next drop which introduces The Empire Strikes Back's Cloud City of Bespin. We'll have to wait then, too, for some more inspired hero selections - Nien Nunb and Greedo form the Outer Rim's offering, but many players will have already unlocked the Sullustan and Rodian skins on which their models are based. \\n\\nGood job, then, that they're slightly more inspired to play as. Nien Nunb in particular is a treat, his abilities giving him access to a turret that makes him play like a devious engineer, while Greedo's quickfire targeting ability is enough to establish who really shot first in that Tatooine bar. Greedo also comes packing a poison gas spewing Dioxis grenade, something also available to other players via an all-new star card. \\n\\nThe front-end has been given a lift, and matchmaking has been fixed too, thankfully - teams now balance after a match, a welcome and slightly overdue addition.\\n\\nThe DLC gadgets and weapons are a mixed bag, too. There's a new blaster pistol in the shape of the DL-18, a quickfire beast that doesn't quite pack the same punch as the DL-44 but compensates by the speed of its flurry. The DLT-19X, meanwhile, is the first real sniper gun available in the game - one shot overheats it, making it absolutely useless in the close quarter combat of the Outer Rim maps, but making it more than welcome elsewhere in the game. Both those guns, though, are free to all players - and the DT-12 pistol that's exclusive to the DLC feels less inspired than its counterparts, making the rapid-fire Relby V-10 the only real prize for those who've coughed up.\\n\\nThe Outer Rim presents a decent enough addition to Battlefront, but it's not quite substantial or varied enough to pull lapsed players back in, and it's not quite the spectacular start to the DLC many had hoped for after waiting so long for the first drop. After only an evening's play I found myself bouncing back to the vanilla game, with little desire to return to the Outer Rim anytime soon. \\n\\nBack there, in the expanses of Battlefront's lightly bolstered map selection, DICE's shooter still shines - it's a slightly vacuous blend of action, but it's a mindless entertainment that's still a joy to get lost in. DICE has done enough to the vanilla Star Wars Battlefront to make the package easier to recommend, but its Season Pass and the first batch of DLC remains a much harder sell. Here's hoping that there's a new hope to be found up in the clouds of Bespin for the next batch of new maps. \\n\", '\\n\\nSeason 2 of the PlayStation original series Powers will debut May 31 on the PlayStation Network.

If you’re interested in AR game design, this seems like your best bet yet.\\n\\nOf course, that’s not saying much -- my AR experience spans Google Glass, an early CastAR prototype and the Nintendo 3DS, none of which are\\xa0exactly a font of AR games. \\n\\nMicrosoft isn’t pitching HoloLens as one either -- the lion’s share of the product’s press demos involve productivity applications, like virtual calendars and Skype windows pinned to real walls or 3D architectural models rendered on office\\xa0tables. \\n\\nBut\\xa0it’s clear that games -- and the developers who make them -- are important to Microsoft’s plans for HoloLens. The company has partnered with Unity to roll out official HoloLens support for the engine, and it was that toolset that I spent an afternoon mucking around with this week.\\n\\nBuilding the\\xa0floating world\\n\\nUnder strict supervision, of course; I can’t overstate how restricted even my extended, developer-oriented walkthrough of the device was. The Unity project we worked with was carefully\\xa0designed ahead of time;\\xa0all I did was progressively add assets to a pre-generated \"balls floating above a table\" scene and slap ready-made scripts on those assets, occasionally passing the build through to Visual Studio and kicking it out directly to the device via USB (though a representative also stated that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options will likely be part of the final product.)\\n\\nIt’s yet unclear how you’ll bring your games to the\\xa0consumer version of the HoloLens, though it seems likely that the process will be much akin to porting your work to the Windows Store -- Microsoft representatives said Windows 10 will ship with \"Windows Holographic\" APIs that should pave the way for developers to convert their\\xa0Windows apps and games for\\xa0augmented reality.\\xa0\\n\\nI’m also not sure when this hardware will see wider release -- Microsoft representatives simply said they expect HoloLens to ship “in the same timeframe as Windows 10” (this summer) and wouldn’t commit to whether that means dev kits or the retail product proper.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe prototype I worked with was a self-contained battery-powered headset (no wires or breakout boxes) capable of matching HoloLens\\' advertised feature set: display 3D virtual objects anchored in the real world and accept voice, gesture and gaze input using microphones, front-facing cameras, an accelerometer and gyroscope for tracking,\\xa0a speaker near each ear that do a damn decent job of producing positional audio, and a discrete processing unit built into the headset.\\n\\nThree processing units, in fact: a CPU, a GPU and a “holographic processing unit” (“HPU”) that handles some of the work of tracking things in 3D space and displaying them properly on the headset’s lenses.\\n\\nLet’s focus on\\xa0those optics for a second,\\xa0because it was through them that I saw one of the biggest discrepancies between HoloLens hype and reality. Microsoft’s slick HoloLens ads subtly sell the fantasy that strapping one to your face will let you see a room covered in virtual gewgaws, but that’s not really true -- the headsets Microsoft brought to Build have a remarkably limited field of virtual view, such that you’re really only capable of perceiving virtual objects overlaid on the real world in a rectangular area of your vision that’s roughly the size of a 42” television sitting six feet in front of you.\\n\\nThis is a still from the sizzle video Microsoft rolled when it unveiled HoloLens in January. If this guy was surveying his AR\\xa0kingdom through the prototype HoloLens I tried, he\\'d only see the cottage directly in front of him and a bit of the pastoral plateau behind it.\\n\\nIn practice, it feels like you’re peering at your\\xa0virtually augmented world through a porthole. For example, I could look directly at a real-world coffee table a few feet away with a virtual game board anchored to it and see the board just fine. But if I walked forward to examine a virtual sphere floating above the board, the board on the low table would quickly scroll off the bottom of the HoloLens display area -- which falls quite a bit short of the edge of the visor itself. Out of the corner of my eye I could still see the real table just fine, but the virtual game table had disappeared like a figment of my imagination.\\n\\nIn roughly two hours of use I never quite got used to this effect, and was regularly dismayed to see virtual objects abruptly flickering into view or having their edges abruptly cut off as I moved my head. I’m concerned that similar limitations in the final version could hold back what game designers can do achieve with HoloLens.\\n\\nOn the other hand, AR isn’t really the ideal medium for immersive, vision-eclipsing experiences -- that’s what VR is designed for\\xa0-- so perhaps it’s for the best that HoloLens games effectively disappear\\xa0when you aren’t focusing directly on them. It makes them more approachable to players who are easily sickened by VR, or who don’t want to wall themselves away from the outside world while they play.\\n\\nAnd the unique capabilities of the headset will, I think, be a boon to developers who put the effort in to design games that take advantage of the HoloLens’ unique feature set. \\n\\nFor example, one of the Unity scripts I worked with effectively created a gaze-controlled virtual cursor by continually checking to see if the headset was looking at a virtual object and, if it was, displaying a red circular cursor mesh on top of that object. I could then effectively “click” on the object by holding my fingers up in front of the visor and making a clicking gesture. I could also design custom voice commands by passing the command as a string of plain text (“honk honk”) to the HoloLens toolkit’s AddKeyword method, then say those commands and trigger in-game interactions.\\n\\nThe prototype’s microphones are remarkably sensitive and forgiving, to boot -- I was able to whisper “honk honk” while standing in a loud, crowded classroom and trigger the headset every time, even when I elongated the syllables enough to sound like a chain-smoking goose flying in slow motion.\\n\\nBut the hardware still has a ways to go if it wants to be more than a cool gimmick. Before VR/AR researcher Michael Abrash left Valve to join Oculus, he published a lengthy blog post outlining some of the inherent challenges of crafting\\xa0\"hard AR\" experiences\\xa0where virtual objects are indistinguishable from real ones. The HoloLens prototype can\\'t do that -- game objects jitter in place when you move around them, and they don\\'t always line up with real-world objects exactly right.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat it does do is make a compelling case for AR as a viable platform for games, one that may be especially appealing to experimentative\\xa0developers who are having a hard time getting their work\\xa0discovered in other, more crowded markets.\\n', \"NEED TO KNOW\\n\\nWhat is it? A beautiful, challenging action RPG.Expect to pay £15/$20Developer Heart MachinePublisher In-houseReviewed on GeForce GTX 970, Intel i7-5820K, 16GB RAMMultiplayer NoneLink Official site\\n\\nThe drifter, a mute warrior draped in a red cloak and wielding a sword made of light, is an enigma. He roams a broken landscape searching for something, but it’s not really clear what. Occasionally he hunches over and coughs up blood, which causes the screen to glitch and flicker. There’s a beguiling mystery about this shadowy figure, like the nameless gunslinger in a Western or a wandering samurai, and the same can be said of Hyper Light Drifter as a whole.\\n\\nIt’s a world of strange machines, ethereal forests, ancient temples, and lifeless, overgrown robots. An evocative intro sequence shows you glimpses of a cataclysmic event—a gleaming futuristic city disappearing in a flash of explosive light—and this seems to be the aftermath. A ruined place littered with the remains of advanced, long forgotten technology. It’s not a dead world—there are people and creatures everywhere, some of which are friendly—but it feels like you're exploring\\xa0the wake of some incredible disaster.\\n\\nIt’s an astonishingly beautiful post-apocalypse, though, brought to life with a vivid colour palette and intricate, pixel art. A haunting, ambient score by Rich ‘Disasterpeace’ Vreeland adds to the melancholy atmosphere, subtly changing to reflect your surroundings. Artistically, it’s a triumph, but the considered, delicate aesthetic is somewhat misleading. There are some moments of quiet exploration, but mostly Hyper Light Drifter is a punishing, fast-paced action game.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt never really tells you anything—about the drifter, the setting, or even what you’re supposed to be doing. This minimalist approach gives it an air of intriguing mystery, but it can also make it feel aimless. You spend the early stages of the game lost and bewildered, trying to make sense of it all. There are other characters, but they speak in gibberish or obscure comic book panels. Arcane symbols decorate the crumbling temples, but you have no way of deciphering them.\\n\\nBut then objectives slowly begin to form in your mind, like the diamond-shaped objects you collect—usually by fighting through dungeons—that fill in parts of a glyph in the village at the heart of the map. The world is interconnected and there’s no attempt to lead you in the right direction. You’ll stumble into areas that seem impossibly difficult, making a mental note to return later when your skills are sharper. This freeform, non-linear structure is occasionally confusing, but gives you a satisfying amount of agency.\\n\\nReally, though, Hyper Light Drifter is all about the combat. Its varied bestiary of enemies are relentlessly aggressive, but they all have attack patterns that can be learned and exploited. It’s when you’re facing several different types at once, usually in confined, trap-filled spaces, that things get difficult. You can dash, fire a gun, and attack with your sword, but can’t endure much damage. Pinpoint timing and carefully observing your opponents' movements\\xa0are key to surviving a battle.

It's time once again for the RPG Reload Podcast, where Eric, Andy, and I discuss all kinds of things RPG and otherwise. First of all, I have to apologize. This was recorded at the height of a nasty cold I had, and I sound exactly how I felt. I hope to be more perky next month. Our featured game this time around is Hunters Episode One [$4.99 / $4.99 (HD)], which isn't exactly a massive epic. That leaves us with lots of time to talk about other things, and gosh, do we ever. I'd say my favorite part of this episode is hearing about Eric's trip to Blizzard to check out the latest Hearthstone [Free] info. I personally don't know much about the game past playing it a few times here and there, but Eric and Andy are scholarly enough to discuss the topic thoroughly.\\n\\nIn addition to our excellent theme song by Sweet Diss And The Comebacks, we've got two pieces of music on this episode. During the break, it's Encounter With The Seven Heroes from Romancing SaGa 2's soundtrack, composed by Kenji Ito. We close out the show with the Theme Of Fire Emblem from the Japan-only Fire Emblem: Mystery Of The Emblem, composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. That might seem weird for an iOS RPG podcast, but we talk a lot about Fire Emblem in this episode. These things happen.\\n\\nIn the next episode, we'll be talking about Crescent Moon's Ravensword: Shadowlands [$6.99], so make sure to set aside a good chunk of time if you want to play along with us! Remember, if you have any questions related to that game or any other RPG, or just want to ask us anything, drop an email to rpgreloadpodcast@gmail.com. On behalf of Eric, Andy, and myself, I hope you all enjoy this month's episode.

Though the Oculus Rift has been an incredibly interesting story (a story afforded by the transparency of that system’s development from prototype to final product)\\xa0it was always the idea of walking around a \"holodeck,\" reaching out, and grabbing things with your hands and moving in a virtual space that was the most appealing to me.\\n\\nWhat the Vive has been all about since it first came to light is holodeck-inspired room-scale VR. That’s not to say Oculus doesn’t have plans for this kind of experience. I played some room-scale games last month that used the Oculus Touch, and they worked just as well as Vive demos. But Vive is here now, and it delivers a room-scale experience that is closer to the promise of VR.\\n\\nSo now that the Vive is available to consumers, let’s take a closer look (Vive provided by Valve):\\n\\nBuyer experience\\n\\nLet’s get one thing out of the way that many of our readers recognize: The Vive (and the Rift for that matter), are prohibitively expensive, and that’s going to limit the size of the market for this new generation of VR. You can argue all day that $800 is a good deal for what the Vive is, but for the mass market, $800 is $800. Nothing puts a damper on my fanboying about VR as much as when someone says “That’s cool! How much?” The scoffs become tangible (yes you can reach out and touch the scoffs) even before you get to the part about how you also need to buy a PC that costs $1000-$1500 and start scouting for\\xa0a bigger apartment.\\n\\n\\nNo, I won\\'t do an unboxing for you.\\n\\nI won\\'t do\\xa0a complete “unboxing” of the Vive here, but I will say that the consumer version was surprisingly easy to set up. HTC’s setup tutorial and Valve’s SteamVR Room Setup app are straightforward, and don’t have a load of complicated steps. The room-scale setup (you actually have a choice between a room-scale, or if you have little space, a standing or sitting setup process) involves recognizing the HMD and controllers, identifying where your monitor is (point at it and hold down the trigger), tracing\\xa0your play space (just walk around the perimeter of the area while holding the trigger), and you’re good to go. Make sure to get that floor calibration right, or else you’ll end up underneath the virtual floor of a slanted room, or about two and a half feet tall.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re now ready to have a dance party around a person who\\'s wearing a mask.\\n\\nIf you can set up a desktop computer’s wiring, you can handle the Vive’s wires. Setup can be completed within an hour. (I took a bit longer because I needed to figure out how to get my Lighthouse base stations to the required height without committing to permanent wall-mounting (wall mounts included).)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot necessarily recommended (but it worked).\\n\\nOne consumer obstacle that this generation of VR may never overcome is the physical space needed to perform room-scale VR. Yes, there are developers who have and are working hard on different solutions for scaling their games for various sizes of rooms (as stated, Vive’s room setup also has a standing/sitting calibration wizard), but for the type of VR that Vive requires, you do need some space, and not everyone has that.\\n\\nOn a hardware\\xa0sidenote, the rig I’m using was last rebuilt in late 2011 (originally built in 2007) and prior to my VR upgrade quest had an i5-2400 3.1 GHz Quad Core processor, and a Radeon HD 6950 1 GB graphics card. That falls short of the Vive’s Intel i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 CPU/Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290 GPU minimium requirement.\\n\\nI bought the required $300 GeForce GTX 970, still expecting to pay $200 more dollars for the 0.2 more GHz of an i5-4590. But after running Valve’s own VR performance test, it said my rig was VR ready, even with the i5-2400 I bought just over four years ago. VR game performance on my PC has been just as good as any official demo I’ve done, proving out the\\xa0fact that VR performance is much more about the capabilities of your GPU rather than your CPU.\\n\\nStardew Valley is gonna look SO GOOD. pic.twitter.com/P2ZsE1VlWM\\n\\nSelling games on Vive\\n\\nIf you’re familiar with Steam’s Big Picture mode, you’re familiar with the storefront. HTC also has a Vive client from which you can launch your games, but most people will use the SteamVR interface. You don’t need to take off the HMD to buy and download VR games, and VR games are curated under a VR showcase section. (On Steam’s storefront, games developed with Oculus in mind are marked with the Oculus “O”, Vive-focused games are marked with the Vive triangle – some are marked with both.) Buying and downloading games is just as easy as it is on Steam’s 2D storefront.\\n\\nLet’s talk about discoverability. Incredibly crowded digital marketplaces are\\xa0one of the factors that most concerns developers releasing games today. How can you make money if no one can discover your game?\\xa0One advantage of making games for VR is that it isn’t mass market right now – there is relatively little competition in this blue ocean. Prior to launch, Steam made about 50 games and demos available to press. This week, Valve assured us there would be “roughly double” that available on launch day.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a new platform launch, that’s an impressive amount of titles, but when comparing that amount to\\xa0how many games you’re competing against on mature app stores, that’s not even beans. It’s hard to say how long that blue ocean will last, but prohibitively-priced hardware that has a limited but not-small market combined with an enthusiastic consumer base that has disposable income might be a good place to be if you’re a small developer who happens to have a good VR game.\\n\\nThat’s not to say that a “good” VR game is guaranteed to make you lots of money today, but at least experimenting in VR, even in a non-commercial capacity, can put you in a better position to capitalize on the VR market as opposed to completely ignoring it.\\xa0The audience for new-gen VR is a very enthusiastic one, and I suspect a nice chunk of that audience will become money-spending VR evangelists. When I spoke with Oculus founder Palmer Luckey last month, he predicted that yes, there will be some games that don’t sell, but there will likely be breakout hits as well. I think he’s probably right, and that that’ll be true of the Vive, too.\\n\\nMaking games for Vive\\n\\nA couple months ago, I had the opportunity to spend a day with Vive developers at a Valve event and they gave me a broad overview of developing for room-scale VR.\\xa0This is what they told me:\\n\\nAlex Schwartz, CEO, Owlchemy Labs\\xa0(Job Simulator 2050)\\n\\n“You can never know how good something’s going to be in VR until you try it out with a headset, with your hands, and it either clicks or it doesn’t. That means the fastest you can iterate is the best route\\xa0for development. We’re not going to sit down and write a [game design document], because it’s going to be wrong. We just try it out in VR.”\\n\\nRichard Stitselaar, creative director, Vertigo Games (Arizona Sunshine)\\n\\n“If you design a game for VR, it should be VR-only. If you take a [non-VR] zombie shooter and think ‘Oh, lemme port that to VR,’ it doesn’t work. The rules have totally changed in game design, at least if you’re building from the ground up for VR…You need to set the rules for yourself.”\\n\\nDylan Fitterer (Audioshield)\\n\\n“You really, really have to watch framerate. You don’t wanna make yourself sick. Also, go for quantity. Try a lot of different things, new concepts. Don’t let yourself fall into one rut too soon.”\\n\\nJoachim Holmér, co-founder, Neat Corp (Budget Cuts)\\n\\n“Ditch everything you know about game design, and just try to think of everything as new. Do a lot of experimentation, a lot of playtesting, and a lot of prototyping. There are so many turns you take during the design process…There are so many things you have to rethink. Just playtest everything.”\\n\\nJoel Green, producer, Cloudhead Games (The Gallery: Six Elements)\\n\\n“I came from BioWare before this, making\\xa0Dragon Age\\xa0and\\xa0Mass Effect\\xa0and those kinds of games. The biggest thing with VR development is,\\xa0not throw away, but be very flexible with a lot of the rules that you’re used to with game development. You have to be super experimental and be willing to accept that a lot of the old ways of doing things just do not work at all anymore. You have to go back to the drawing board. Everybody I see who came to VR development from the triple-A community, or just from non-VR development, they kind of go through this process of letting go of all the things they hold onto really tightly, because you spent your career learning all these things and you have a bit of pride in the fact that you know what you’re doing. And then you get into VR, it’s like, actually you don’t [know what you’re doing].”\\n\\nLindsay Jorgensen, artist, Radial Games/Northway Games\\xa0(Fantastic Contraption)\\n\\n“For us, [our big lesson] is a comfort level thing. You have to be very, very careful about making your environment a nice place if you expect somebody to stay there for any length of time. That’s because as opposed to something on the screen, stuff in VR has a times-one-million multiplier on mood and effect on the person. There’s going to be a lot of jump scare games, and those are going to be really scary, because [the scares are] right there. In\\xa0Contraption, we wanted it to be a place where you stay for maybe two hours to think about a problem. We wanted you to be comfortable—it’s nice [in the game], it’s sunny, it’s a friendly place to be. Keep it nice…and don’t make people sick!”\\n\\nJustin Liebregts, CTO, Futuretown (Cloudlands: VR Minigolf)\\n\\n“Try to make as many different prototypes as you can. At the beginning, we did ping pong, we did squash, throwing, shooting, bowling…we all did that in a about two days, just to see what [VR] was capable of, these tactile kind of tactile interactions…There’s a lot of discovery. You’re probably going to end up throwing away most of the work that you’re going to work on, but that’s ok. That’s part of learning and part of being in the VR space right now.”\\n\\nAlex Knoll, lead game designer, Stress Level Zero (Hover Junkers)\\n\\n“I think a lot of people, once they get the tech and start making games for it, they immediately come to the conclusion that everything you do in real life feels natural in-game. But what we found is that everything you do in-game that you wish you could do superpowers-wise in real-life translates to VR as infinitely more powerful…You want to have a little bit more of a supernatural ability [in VR] than you do in real life, which is an interesting psychological study, I’m sure, just waiting to happen.”\\n\\nPatrick Hackett, co-founder, Skillman & Hackett (Tilt Brush)\\n\\n“The resounding message that I always have is, with VR—and this kind of applies to any medium, but especially, especially in VR: spend time in it, and listen to what it does good. Then develop an experience around that. VR is really prone to this problem of people seeing a new market and then making experiences that they’re used to…but room-scale VR especially requires you to take a step back and look at this thing as a blank page.”\\n\\nVR\\'s past, present, future\\n\\nThe right game can convert even the most jaded VR skeptic to someone who at least can admit there is a future here. VR is a medium, like film or books. Just because a film or a book – or a VR experience –falls short of one’s expectations doesn’t mean that the entire medium be damned. I’ve seen people swear up and down that VR is a fad, a flash in the pan novelty. But then they play, say, Fantastic Contraption, and it melts the hardest heart, if just a little. It turns out that VR isn’t strictly about the headset or the positional trackers; it’s about the experiences the hardware and software can provide, and there are a lot of highly talented game developers realizing\\xa0this and making games for VR.\\n\\nThere are still people who will continue to be convinced that VR will again be a short-lived, empty\\xa0hype phenomenon, burning\\xa0bright and fizzling\\xa0out much like previous generations of VR, or fanciful tech like Kinect or\\xa03D TV. That could be true, anything’s possible. But the main difference I see today is a large grassroots community of creators who are more connected and enthusiastic about this technology than in the hype of yore. That enthusiasm and willingness to execute is\\xa0coupled with support from companies with major pull such as Unity, Epic, Valve, Sony, Facebook and others that have a vested financial interest in fostering these communities of creators.\\n\\nThat’s a powerful combination. Often you’ll see new tech possess one or the other: either a big tech company tries to force a new product line down peoples’ throats (hello 3D TV) or an enthusiastic community of creators is small and doesn’t have the support from the companies for which they’d like to make content.\\n\\nI\\'ve not played every single Vive launch game, but there are certainly a few that stand out. Early Access game\\xa0Space Pirate Trainer by I-Illusions has the visuals and music that make you feel like you\\'re inside an arcade machine, fighting off waves of robots with a gun and shield as you defend your ship.\\xa0Job Simulator 2050\\xa0from Owlchemy Labs has a cartooney aesthetic that belies its complex physics and incredibly intuitive approach to interaction in VR.\\xa0Tilt Brush\\xa0by Google-owned\\xa0Skillman &\\xa0Hackett is a VR art\\xa0app that anyone can pick up and create something beautiful. And\\xa0Fantastic Contraption\\xa0from Radial Games and Northway Games is so charming and intuitive that it\\'s easy to lose track of time, even when you\\'re wearing\\xa0a big black mask and have\\xa0a wire hanging off your head.\\n\\nIt\\'s that intuitiveness that all of the\\xa0games above share, to varying extents. The best VR\\xa0developers on Vive and Oculus Touch recognize that they need to take advantage of the expectations for interaction that people (not just \"players\") bring with them into a virtual space. Once creators understand peoples\\' expectations, they\\xa0can start playing with those expectations in fun and interesting ways.\\n\\nOculus and PlayStation are impressive in their own right, and are due to catch up,\\xa0but the Vive comes closest to the promise of VR because it does do room-scale right now and it does it well. There’s less abstraction with Vive just because today you can move around and grab things. It’s the ability to tap into the intuition of players that makes VR so exciting from a game dev perspective. Granted, all VR right now has significant issues with practicality that make it difficult to recommend to the average person, but Vive and its best games\\xa0give\\xa0a more generous peek at what’s in store for VR’s future. With a little imagination, you can see why that future is\\xa0so\\xa0exciting.\\n', '\\n\\nWhat trickery is this?

As the devs put it, \"This is not the greatest game in the world, no; This is just a tribute.\"\\n\\nThey\\'re not the first team to experiment with voxels in your browser—there\\'s\\xa0a functional NES emulator that extrapolates 3D models from sprites in any ROM you care to feed it.\\n', '\\n\\nMinecraft and its Telltale-developed spinoff, Minecraft: Story Mode, are united at last.

Competitive Play is now available and aimed at players \"seeking a more serious challenge\" in\\xa0Blizzard\\'s hero-based shooter.\\n\\nOverwatch\\'s new Competitive Play mode will let players rank up through a series of divisions and tiers in monthly seasons. It\\'s restricted to players level 25 and above, game director Jeff Kaplan said, in an effort to keep brand-new players out of the system, ensuring that Competitive Play is populated with players who are familiar with Overwatch\\'s maps and characters.\\n\\nCompetitive Play will offer five tiers for players to advance through: challenger, advanced, expert, master and heroic. Each tier has five divisions, and players can rank up from division one to five, then progress to the next tier. Kaplan notes that players can\\'t lose ranking points in the challenge tier; they always make upward progress until they reach the advanced tier.\\n\\nThe top tier, heroic, is similar to Hearthstone\\'s legendary ranking. Should a player reach that competitive tier, they\\'ll see how they rank against other heroic tier players around the world.\\n\\nKaplan says that not all features of Competitive Play are implemented yet, and the \"pre-season\" that Blizzard is running in the beta may extend into the full release of Overwatch. Kaplan said Blizzard has \"further plans in the future to make [Competitive Play] cooler.\"\\n\\nOverwatch\\'s latest update also adds new progression rewards, in the form of legendary character skins, and new punishments for players who frequently quit out of games. Players who leave matches before they\\'re done will eventually get a warning from Blizzard, and if they repeatedly leave, they\\'ll incur an XP gain penalty.\\n\\nMore details on the latest changes to Overwatch are available in\\xa0Blizzard\\'s patch notes and in Kaplan\\'s video below.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n', '\\n\\nBlizzard has reportedly fired a warning shot over a major unauthorized World of Warcraft server.

Unauthorized servers are a clear violation of the World of Warcraft terms of service, and it appears that the group’s activities violate elements of the TOS that expressly prohibit this kind of thing.\\n\\nThe group behind the effort says it will continue to provide the means for players to create their own servers. The source code will be made available, and anonymized player data will provided so the community can decide how it wants to proceed. It’s not clear yet how Blizzard feels about these developments (but we’ve inquired).\\n\\nThe Nostalrius team has also created a petition in hopes of getting Blizzard to change its policy regarding private servers that capture older game states. The group says that it has 800,000 registered users, 150,000 of which are still active.\\n\\nWe’ll update should Blizzard respond to our request for comment.\\n\\n[Source: Nostalrius via Eurogamer]\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOur TakeThe Nostalrius petition essentially asks Blizzard to forego revenue related to its brand and products so that people can circumvent subscriptions. The document admits that there might be copyright issues while the group also claims it didn’t see itself as a threat to the publisher.

InnoGames\\' Dennis Rohlfing makes a good point about the market viability of paid games: \"If you want to generate profit, that’s clearly possible. If you want annual revenues of $20m for a couple of years? No chance. The top paid games are not present in the top grossing charts.\" \\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s a good reason from a business standpoint why so many more games are going free-to-play. Consider that paid games are a risk for developers of all sizes to make – they often have short prime shelf life and even launching the wrong week can be disastrous. A free-to-play game may be a bigger risk in comparison – the production costs of making a game-as-a-service and the testing, support, and monetization work that they require are often greater than making a pay-once game – but the reward can be orders of magnitude greater. And when you factor in that the attitude on mobile in particular has become that the mass market wants free-to-play, it makes sense for publishers and developers to go that way.\\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t make sense for everyone – paid games can still be profitable, in part because there is an audience there still. There are still stories of developers being profitable with their paid games – and especially smaller developers can afford to take creative risks. I\\'ve often thought that paid games on mobile, while practically a rounding error at this point, will someday have a viable niche for the people that enjoy them and developers that want to create those games. But it may involve a lot of shifting attitudes and more console/PC gamers accepting mobile platforms.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the article is worth reading, as there\\'s interesting insights on mid-core games (with someone providing a decent definition for once), and the possibilities of hardcore games and players hitting mobile, along with the potential of mobile VR. All of which I\\'m admittedly optimistic about, but it\\'s worth reading what some power players in the mobile gaming industry have to say about it.\\n', '\\nThere\\'s a common joke made about Monopoly that it destroys lives. The massively popular love-letter to capitalist greed has become notorious for its ability to ruin friendships, end relationships, and shatter family-ties like brittle glass. Whether Monopoly truly is a cardboard home-wrecker is up for debate, but what is certain is that, whatever damage Monopoly does or doesn\\'t do, when the game is over and the emotional smoke has cleared, the board and pieces go back into the box unchanged.\\n\\nBut you can\\'t shelve life. You can\\'t fold everything neatly away, or place memories in little plastic bags and fit them into the appropriately moulded inserts. Everything that happens to you stays with you, and that extends to playing a game like Monopoly. When you next work up the courage to unfold that time-bomb of a board, it might not have changed, but you will have. You\\'ll know your dad will try to buy all of the train stations, and that your mum always builds a hotel on Old Kent Road. So you\\'ll shift your strategy to counter those tendencies, and your family will change their tactics to counter yours. \\n\\nIt was a similar observation, only about Cluedo, that led boardgame designer Rob Daviau to have an idea - what if the game changed along with the player\\'s experience of it? \"In a brainstorm for Cluedo we were talking, and I made the comment of \\'I dunno why they keep inviting these people to dinner, they\\'re all mass murderers,\\' Daviau says. \"And it was this moment where I went \\'Oh yeah!\\' The game kind of starts over like the movie groundhog day. But the players don\\'t start over.\" This idea has resulted in what is undoubtedly the most radical board gaming innovation of recent years, that of Legacy gaming. Thus far Daviau has explored the idea in two stellar games, Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy, and he\\'s currently working on a third, Seafall.\\n\\nRob Daviau\\n\\nAlthough Daviau\\'s work has only come to prominence fairly recently, he has been designing boardgames for almost 20 years. Having initially worked as an advertising copywriter, in 1998 Daviau joined Hasbro as a writer for text-heavy games like Trivial Pursuit and Taboo, a unique role that the company hasn\\'t hired for before or since.  \"I happened to fit that bill and very quickly realised that I loved the design part more than the writing part,\" he says. \"I moved my job as fast as I could to be a pure designer and learned as I went.\"\\n\\nIn his time as Hasbro, Daviau worked on dozens of titles, including versions of well-known games like Cluedo, and \"more Risk versions than anyone else.\" Yet while most of Daviau\\'s design experience resides with family-friendly games with fairly simple rulesets, his heart has always belonged to roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons. \"Roleplaying games have persistent worlds,\" Daviau explains. \"You write on a character\\'s sheet. I remember when I was a kid and a character would die, someone ripped it in half and it was very dramatic.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s these dual strands to Daviau\\'s boardgaming background, his love for deep, persistent RPG worlds and his experiences designing simpler, general-audience games, that would prove crucial to seeing the Legacy concept realised. Daviau\\'s Cluedo-based realisation happened around 2008, and he pitched the idea of Cluedo Legacy to Hasbro\\'s management, but they rejected it outright. \"They looked at me like I was crazy,\" Daviau says.  \"So I thought \\'Well, maybe this is a crazy idea.\\' And I put it away.\"\\n\\nWhile initially sceptical, the idea stuck in the minds of Daviau\\'s superiors. A couple of years later, it rose to the surface again when discussing potential new versions of Risk. \"My boss asked me to come up with ideas. And I think he remembered it and he said \\'Well how about that perpetual game idea?\\' Daviau thought about this, and realised that Risk would make for an ideal template for a Legacy game, because of its strategic elements and how emotional it makes people when they play it. \\n\\n\"It just makes people mad,\" Daviau says. \"It makes you mad when the dice don\\'t go your way. And it makes you mad when someone breaks their word. So you just carry these memories and scars around.\" Risk Legacy would play with this idea, enabling players to physically \"scar\" the board, affecting the rules of future games. The more games they played, the more dramatic those effects would become. Players could found cities on the board, tear up cards into confetti, unlock new factions to play as,  even detonate a nuclear device in a particular country, making it almost impossible to hold in future games. \"I had a big toolbox of ideas that I could draw on having done six or seven or eight earlier Risk games,\" Daviau says.\\n\\nRisk Legacy took around 18 months to develop, with Daviau working on almost every aspect of it, from writing the cards to directing the art and even making sales videos. \"I was quite excited by it as a new possibility, but there was always that spectre looming of \\'This is the dumbest thing I\\'ve ever thought of, and everyone who plays it is going to laugh me out of the industry.\\' Quite the contrary, Risk Legacy released in 2011 to rave reviews, and by the end of 2012 it was one of the most talked-about games around. Commercially its success was a drop in the ocean for Hasbro, but Daviau sees this as a good thing. \"I got to go beneath the radar, which was good, because I wouldn\\'t have gotten it out if there had been a lot of attention on it.\"\\n\\nAfter the launch of Risk Legacy, Daviau departed Hasbro, striking it out as an independent boardgame designer. He began working on a new Legacy game, but this was interrupted at GenCon 2013, when Daviau was contacted by Matt Leacock, the creator of the massively successful Pandemic, about the possibility of co-designing a Legacy version of his cooperative boardgame about saving the world from a global disease outbreak. \"I wrote back in an email, which I had forgotten but that he always talks about, in 150 point type. It said \\'YES\\', and that was the entire email,\" Daviau recalls.\\n\\nThe idea of merging Pandemic\\'s simple yet engrossing rules with Daviau\\'s legacy concept may sound like a recipe for instant success. But Pandemic Legacy proved a far more tricky design problem because of its cooperative emphasis. \"There\\'s so much outside the designers control on a Legacy game, that I need other players to be a balancing agent. In Risk Legacy if someone starts winning a lot the other players will gang up on them,\" Daviau explains.  In Pandemic, however, the players are all working together to outsmart the game\\'s systems, and with a Legacy game\\'s gradual upping of the ante, it\\'s very easy to end up with one side simply overwhelming the other.\\n\\nLeacock and Daviau tackled this problem by introducing two new game mechanics. Firstly, funding for players changes each game. If players win a game of Pandemic Legacy, they are given fewer \\'Event\\' cards for the next game. If they lose, they receive more. This helps nullify the common game-design problem of snowballing, where winning leads to more winning and losing leads to further losing. \\n\\nTheir other solution was to provide players with a broad range of tools so they could choose how to approach problems specific to their game. \"If you\\'re playing the game and you\\'re not having trouble curing diseases, but you\\'re really having trouble moving around the board. Then you can make research stations permanent, so you\\'ll start the next game with the ability to move. And another group might have no problem moving but having trouble with the diseases. So they will make the diseases easier to treat in the next game,\" Daviau points out.\\n\\nPandemic Legacy launched in October 2015, releasing simultaneously in around 13 different languages across the globe. Unlike Risk Legacy, which gained its reputation over a couple of years, Pandemic Legacy was an instant hit. Despite being out less than six months, it is currently rated by BoardGameGeek as the best game in existence. ShutUpAndSitDown also voted it their favourite game of 2015, toppling longtime favourite Cosmic Encounter.\\n\\nWhat\\'s particularly fascinating about the success of Daviau\\'s Legacy concept is that its two current incarnations are reinterpretations of already existing games. We\\'ve yet to see a Legacy game that is built entirely from scratch, with those persistent rules baked into the base version. However, that will change later this year when Daviau releases Seafall, the first Legacy game designed from the ground up, and the first game Daviau has created entirely by himself.\\n\\nSet in alternate universe based on Europe\\'s colonial period in the 16th and 17th centuries, Seafall sees players controlling individual provinces, sending ships around the fictional globe to explore, trade with and conquer new territories. Starting out with a board that comprises mostly of empty ocean, players will gradually discover new islands, trade routes, and dozens of other things as the game progresses. To give you an idea of how expansive Seafall is, it includes a 427-page \\'Events\\' book inspired by the classic storytelling game Tales of the Arabian Nights.\\n\\n\"What I noticed in Risk Legacy is people liked opening things and liked finding things. When you open the boxes, or the envelopes, it was always the most exciting bit,\" Daviau says. \"So I thought \\'Well what if I started with a game where you really had as little as possible, just kind of an empty sea. So you weren\\'t just going to find six things - you\\'re going to find four hundred things?\\' These discoveries are multilayered too. If a player finds a new island in the ocean, they will be able to explore that island, at which point they might stumble upon an ancient tomb, the tomb might lead to treasure, which provides that player with rewards, and so on.\\n\\nInitially Daviau planned Seafall to be a vast, complex 4X game with the Legacy mechanic worked into it. But this quickly proved far too cumbersome. He noticed that a Legacy game works best when the basic ruleset is simple, and the complexity is gradually layered in over several games. Take Seafall\\'s ships, the base unit players use to explore the board. In Daviau\\'s early prototypes, ships were intensely micromanaged; everything from crew to ammo to cargo could be replaced and expanded. Now, however, ship modifiers are based on the names that each vessel is given. Alongside the ship\\'s starting name like \"Viper\" or \"Sparrow\", two further adjectives can be added \"Intrepid\" or \"Stalwart\", each of which provides a different bonus to that ship\\'s particular abilities. \"A big game design problem is \\'more is better\\', snd so I had to learn a little bit the hard way on Seafall that less is just fine,\" Daviau says.\\n\\nDaviau is currently putting the finishing touches to Seafall, with a plan to launch the game at this year\\'s GenCon in August. And there are more Legacy games coming. Daviau is already working on Season 2 of Pandemic Legacy with Matt Leacock. He\\'s also working with another designer, Dirk Knemeyer, on a tiny little idea called Chronicles, which sees players recreate their own version of western civilisation. \\n\\nIn the first Chronicles box, titled Origins, players assume control of Stone Age tribes. \"You will play eight games, and each game will generate a different tribe with its own background and personality and quirks and outlook on the world. And then, after you have eight tribes, you will take a certain number of them... and those will fast-forward  several thousand years to be Bronze Age Kingdoms, and these Kingdoms will have different outlooks and personalities based on what happened to them thousands of years ago.\"\\n\\nJust four years ago Daviau was working for Hasbro designing Star Wars and Lord of the Rings variations of Risk. Now he is designing his own games, exploring the entirety of history. \"I\\'m just a guy working out of his house, and trying to make enough money to, y\\'know, keep the house, and so I don\\'t have time right now for any perspective,\" he says of the shift in fortunes. \" But if you told my twelve-year-old self \\'what do you want to be doing when you grow up,\\' this would have been it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bethesda Game Studios is\\xa0expanding the private beta for Fallout 4\\'s Creation Kit, the official mod support toolkit coming to the game sometime in the next month or two.\\n\\nInformation on how to register for the invitation-only test is here.

Maybe; maybe not--but The Avengers\\' Ultron makes a good case for the affirmative.\\n\\nDepending on which Marvel story you prefer, Ultron was either (a) first programmed with the consciousness of its creator, Dr. Henry Pym, \"blessing\" the robot with a unique madness that fueled its hatred for the human race; or (b) created using an alien intelligence who thinks he must destroy humanity to save Earth. Either way, Ultron then moves to exterminate everybody.\\n\\nMotivations aside, that seems like some pretty evil stuff, at least from this human\\'s point of view.\\n\\n(Image credit: Disney)\\n\\n\\n\\n17.

The results were not promising, with Tabata saying in a new interview that the franchise was considered a \"dying IP that had already peaked.\"\\n\\n\"The gravest situation of all was that, at the time we were starting Final Fantasy XV, we didn\\'t see an increase in new fans of the franchise,\" he says in the latest issue of Game Informer. \"The brand image of Final Fantasy wasn\\'t really clear.\\n\\n\"The reality is not that the situation is okay or in favor of us. Rather, it is more grave and serious than we had initially thought,\" he added. \"The way we understood Final Fantasy after our analysis is that it was a dying IP that had already peaked.\"\\n\\nThis being the sentiment, you might wonder why Square Enix would go forward with Final Fantasy XV.

Striker style makes use of the new Hunter Arts, allowing you to build up special moves that range from healing fountains to a Gunlance blast that moves you forward.

If you do enjoy Sailor Moon and her quirky sidekicks, you'll be glad to know that after a few months in Japan, SailorMoon Drops\\xa0[Free] has come to the US App Store. As for the gameplay, I'll give you exactly one guess to figure out how this game plays. Yes, a match-3 indeed. All of the characters have been transformed into cute versions of themselves, and the game does contain a storyline that you'll play through as you solve those match-3 puzzles. The game includes many familiar characters (both friends and enemies), and is definitely very cute to look at.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nAs you clear stages, you level up your characters and unlock special moves (and also cute poses), and even gather various collection pieces to unlock wallpapers. You can play with or against your friends, and you can play either in portrait or landscape, a small thing for some but kind of important for me because I don't always like the portrait mode, especially on my iPad. The game is out now in the US, and is, of course, F2P, so if you like Sailor Moon, go pick it up. It does have great reviews on the App Store, so it might be worth a try even if you aren't the biggest Sailor Moon fan but simply like match-3 games.\\n\\n\\n\", 'At a recent event I had a chance to play Gears of War 4 multiplayer on Xbox One (Microsoft has yet to announce a PC version but it seems like a safe bet), and it\\'s pretty good. It\\'s familiar in that it feels very much like Gears of War multiplayer - Gears of War 3 multiplayer, that is, as opposed to Gears of War: Judgment\\'s - but there are a few tweaks to the gameplay that stand out, and one new weapon that\\'s sure to go down well.\\n\\nYour character, a suitably beefy human or mutant enemy type depending on which side you\\'re on, moves around in that tank-like Gears of War way. And all the up close and personal brutality the series is famous for is present and correct: the Gnasher shotgun still turns your enemies into chunks of meat, the Lancer still chainsaws your foes in half, and the Longshot still pops heads from across the map. Gears of War 4 is as much a cover-based third-person shooter as the first three games in the series were, and you find yourself moving in and out alongside your teammates on the hunt for flanking positions and power weapons.\\n\\nBut developer The Coalition, which has taken charge of Gears of War development duty following Microsoft\\'s purchase of the franchise from Epic Games, has added new cover mechanics in an attempt to improve the cover system, while retaining that Gears feel.\\n\\nOne of the big issues with Gears of War multiplayer is that you\\'d sometimes find yourself embroiled in silly looking shootouts against an enemy who was crouched behind the same piece of cover as you. You\\'d pop up and fire your Gnasher, then your enemy would pop up and fire theirs. It was the video game version of that Naked Gun scene where they end up chucking their guns at each other.\\n\\nThe Coalition reckons it\\'s solved this problem by adding the Yank and Shank move. Here, you\\'re able to pull your opponent over cover to your side, and open them up to a combat knife execution. It\\'s considered a defensive alternative to a mantle kick, the cover mechanic Epic introduced with Gears 3.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that you can counter a Yank and Shank. There\\'s a brief window of opportunity to do it. But if you mistime the counter, you\\'re dead.\\n\\nAlso new is the Vault Kick. This lets you leap over cover without stopping and kick your opponent. It\\'s designed to be a faster alternative to the mantle kick, which requires you snap to cover before the mantle move. Like the Yank and Shank, if you nail an enemy with the Vault Kick, you leave them open to a combat knife finishing move. But, again, like the Yank and Shank, it can be countered.\\n\\nUsefully, the Vault Kick can be used to seamlessly mantle cover even when there isn\\'t an enemy on the other side. It\\'s a little difficult to master the timing, but once you do, you can press and hold the A button on the Xbox One pad to roadie run, then roll your thumb to the B button to vault over cover when you get close. This, in combination with The Coalition\\'s commitment to 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second visuals in multiplayer, should make for a satisfyingly fluid and responsive PvP experience.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to tell at this stage whether these new cover moves will significantly change up the way Gears of War multiplayer works for this game. The Coalition chief Rod Fergusson says these moves are optional, but learning to use them well will make you a better, more effective, player.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like Active Reload,\" he says. \"You can play the game without ever Active Reloading. But if you do Active Reload you feel rewarded for it and it changes how you play. The same is true for close cover combat.\"\\n\\nBut what I can say for sure is that the whole thing leaves Gears of War: Judgement\\'s first-person shooter influenced style behind - and that\\'s a good thing.\\n\\nJudgment was Gears meets first-person shooters, minus the camera perspective. It had first-person shooter controls, first-person shooter movement, and PvP was human versus human.\\n\\nFergusson said lessons had been learnt on that one.\\n\\n\"It was an interesting experiment from a team that had been working on the game for over seven years,\" he says.\\n\\n\"We learned a lot from it, but it felt like we were chasing. When I got to The Coalition, it was about lead, don\\'t chase. Rather than going after somebody else\\'s success or what\\'s hot in the market, go deep on what makes Gears what it is, and embrace that fully.\"\\n\\nI got to play team deathmatch and the new Dodgeball mode (more on that later) across three maps. Harbor is a nighttime map.\\n\\nDam is a daytime map.\\n\\nAnd Foundation, a Coalition settlement, is somewhere in between. Each is packed with cover, choke points and areas in which power weapons beg to be picked up.\\n\\nTalking of power weapons, Gears of War 4 adds a new one that I reckon will be an instant favourite.\\n\\nThe Dropshot lets you fire a drill-bit with an explosive head on it. When you fire, it sends the drill-bit out with a laser sight that tells you where it will land. When it gets far enough, you let go of the trigger and it drills down and blows up. It\\'s a bit like the Torque Bow. You pull the trigger and hold, and at the right moment release. Then boom.\\n\\nIt\\'s cool for a few of reasons. One, it\\'s pretty funny to nail someone with it, as they explode in typical Gears fashion. Two, if you use it to execute a downed enemy, you boot them across the map with a drill-bit attached. And three, it lets you go over cover and attack holed up enemies - something we\\'re not used to doing in Gears of War.\\n\\nBack to the game modes. I mentioned the five versus five team deathmatch Gears of War PvP is built upon. One new mode I quite liked was Dodgeball. Here, if you\\'re eliminated, you can be brought back in by one of your teammates if they score a kill. So, even if you\\'re the last player standing against five enemies, there\\'s a chance to slowly but surely make a dramatic comeback: 1v5 becomes 2v4, then all of a sudden it\\'s 3v3 and it\\'s game on.\\n\\nDodgeball reinforces what I love best about Gears of War multiplayer: it\\'s skill-based, and every player counts. Battles rage on a level playing field, no matter how many hours you\\'ve put in. Your Gnasher is as powerful as their Gnasher. And, crucially, because Gears is a five versus five, kills matter. You can make a difference.\\n\\nDodgeball drills down into that feeling. When you\\'re the last person standing, you\\'re in cover, the camera\\'s tight and the enemy is on you, you know if you can kill just one enemy player your team might win. It\\'s good fun!\\n\\nWhile Gears of War 4 competitive multiplayer is reassuringly familiar with a few welcome but subtle changes, I feel like it\\'s outside the gameplay where The Coalition makes the most significant changes.\\n\\nThe Coalition is doing something pretty cool with maps. Here\\'s how it works: the game comes with 10 maps (nine new and a remake of Gridlock). Those you own, as you\\'d expect, and you\\'re free to play them whenever you want.\\n\\nBut, post-launch maps will be added to the mix each month in a rotation. It\\'s a bit like what League of Legends does with its champions. The idea here is to avoid splitting the userbase by selling map packs, as Gears games have done in the past. Instead, The Coalition will curate its DLC map offering.\\n\\nIf you want to play a DLC map when it\\'s out of rotation, you can buy it with real-world money. From there, you can host a private match, inviting nine friends to play the map you\\'ve bought. The cool thing is those nine friends don\\'t need to own the map to play. They just need the invite from someone who does.\\n\\nFergusson uses a restaurant analogy to explain the approach:\\n\\n\"I like to think of it like a seasonal menu at a restaurant. Pumpkin ravioli is a classic on a fall menu. Let\\'s say it\\'s March and now it\\'s the spring menu and it\\'s citrus salad. And I\\'m like, damn it! I really want my pumpkin ravioli. How do I get my pumpkin ravioli? If pumpkin ravioli is the most important thing to you, you can actually buy pumpkin ravioli, and play it privately. So every time I go in the restaurant, it doesn\\'t matter what time of year it is, I can always get pumpkin ravioli.\"\\n\\nAnd here\\'s another cool thing Gears of War 4 multiplayer is doing: it adds a new co-op versus mode designed to make it easier for new players to transition from Campaign to Versus.\\n\\nLike so many shooters, Gears of War multiplayer can be a daunting experience. Experienced players can tear up the less experienced in the blink of an eye, and because every player counts in Gears of War PvP, teammates don\\'t suffer fools gladly.\\n\\nGears of War 4\\'s Co-Op Versus mode lets players matchmake onto the same team to compete against new AI bots - AI bots that benefit from the transition from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4. The bots have personality types, Fergusson says, and so assume roles in the team. Some are aggressive, some hold back and go for the sniper. Some use cover smartly.\\n\\nIt\\'s a \"safer\" experience, Fergusson says.\\n\\n\"In the past what\\'s happened is, a new player would come in, say, I\\'ve heard a lot about Gears of War multiplayer, I wonder what that\\'s like? And they get in and get shotgunned in the face five times and go, screw that. I\\'m going to go back and play the campaign.\"\\n\\nUsefully, Gears of War 4\\'s experience point gain system works across all modes, so you\\'ll level up by playing Co-Op Versus just as you will if you play PvP or campaign. And by gaining experience you\\'ll earn in-game credits, which are used for, wait for it, buying Gear Crates, which contain, wait for it, virtual cards!\\n\\nLike every game nowadays, Gears of War 4 features crates and cards. Blame Hearthstone. Blame Team Fortress 2. Blame whatever. This is modern gaming.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works: there are three tiers of Gear Crates, which include varying amounts of durable and consumable cards that come in four rarities.\\n\\nIn Versus MP, only personalisation Gear Cards, such as weapon and character skins, are available to players. Phew! There are also Consumable Bounty Gear Cards, such as get an XP boost for scoring 10 headshots with a certain character, but these are only consumed when the player accomplishes the Bounty. So while there\\'s a degree of risk associated with their use, it\\'s not a big one.\\n\\nAs you\\'d expect, you can buy Gear Crates with real-world money. Fergusson, who stressed everything is earnable in-game without spending money, says the system is for those who perhaps don\\'t have the time to pump hours and hours into the game.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re like me and you\\'re 47 and you have a job and kids, maybe you can\\'t play 20 hours this weekend,\" he says.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a way you can enrich your own experience by using real money. But that\\'s not necessary. Everything in PvP is a personalisation, its customisation. It\\'s optional. It\\'s a weapon skin. It\\'s a character skin. There\\'s nothing in the cards for versus multiplayer that changes the game. It\\'s just about how you look. Everything is earnable through in-game credits. It\\'s only if you want to expedite that, you can if you want use real currency.\"\\n\\nWhy would you bother? Gears of War 4 sounds like it has a much deeper weapon skin system than previous games in the series. With this game, you can skin up to 12 weapons, so now when you pick up a Boom Shot it\\'ll have your skin on it.\\n\\nSo there you have it: Gears of War 4 multiplayer is familiar fun, and structured in a clever way. The beta begins on 18th April for those who played Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox One or Windows 10. It opens up to Xbox Live Gold members on 24th April.\\n', '\\n\\nThe Unspoken is an upcoming VR title from Insomniac exclusively for Oculus Rift and its touch controllers. \\n\\nThe first-person spell-casting multiplayer game has players fight against one another in an urban, magical world.

It’s an ideal format for cooperative multiplayer games, yet seldom actually used. Dead Star, however, jumps headlong into old-school space combat to create a multiplayer-focused game that works amazingly well.\\n\\nAfter warring factions decimate most life in the universe, a new era of peace emerges. Dead Star focuses on the prison system, where those who dare to defy this peace are thrown without hope of reprieve. Underneath the burning red light of a dying star and policed by an AI warden who destroys any ships that try to leave, this barren landscape is filled with resources, old ship carcasses, and asteroids.\\n\\nDead Star controls much like a twin-stick shooter, but with a lot more limitations. Unlike most pure arcade-style shooters, weapon range heavily impacts strategy. You’ll start off in a weak, underpowered ship with incredibly limited firing range, which keeps you focused on close-quarters combat. It’s a wise move, especially during crowded battles, when rampant cross-fire can lead to mass frustration.\\n\\nBetween the limited range and power consumption of the many weapon system options, Dead Star manages to become much more tactical in nature than a similar single-player game might be. Wild, desperate shooting usually leads to a quick death, forcing you to learn the ins and outs of your ship and load out during the game's early stages.\\n\\nThe variety of weapons is a big draw. There's the standard array of quick firing lasers, missiles, and other familiar sci-fi shooter mainstays, but as things progress, newer ships and options offer impressively strategic and creative slower firing weapons: huge energy balls that roll forward through space surrounded by clouds of destructive power and other big risk/big reward weapons of mass destruction.\\n\\nThere are AI drones that will follow and orbit your ship to provide extra support as well, and each ship offers myriad upgrade options. Dead Star features three different development tracks for ships (with a fourth on the way), each focused on a specific alien race. Within each track are three ship types offering distinctly different play experiences. The Scouts are fast and maneuverable, but light on firepower. Raiders are slower, but offer great attack potential. For tank-lovers, the frigate-class vessels offer size and potentially immense destructive power, but their large size and slow speed means they need a lot of support.\\n\\nEach line of ships has a distinct look and weapon style, but, as expected in multiplayer games, don’t differ enough from their alien counterparts to create gameplay imbalances. In addition to pure ship-on-ship action, the landscapes sport their own set of dangers and opportunities. The Dead Star system is a battlefield graveyard, full of dead ships and the burnt leftovers of destroyed planets. Giant tunneled-out rocks float through space, allowing players to hide and discover ore deposits. Smaller obstacles need to be avoided, which can be challenging in the heat of combat.\\n\\nMine ore is traded at home bases for currency that allows for ship upgrades and players also earn upgrades through level progression. This gives Dead Star a solid sense of continuity without being a completely persistent world, and this sense of forward momentum is vital to the experience.\\n\\nIn the standard Conquest mode, two teams fight to take over specific AI-controlled base stations. When one team conquers the whole sector, they win. Its simple to get into and allows for a wide range of play styles. Players who just want to fly around and blow things up will be just as at home as those who prefer to tactically take over real estate and provide support.\\n\\nGet far enough in Conquest mode and the Escape Run mode will unlock, which plays directly into Dead Star's overall plot. It seems that the system’s sun is about to literally die—it could go supernova any time, destroying everything in its path. So, the inmates are in a fervor to find a leftover capital ship from the old war and warp out of there. Escape Run lets a team of four commandeer a capital ship and attempt to make it through multiple sectors to reach a jump point (thus winning the match). The gimmick is that those sectors are actually other Conquest games in progress.\\n\\nWhen a capital ship enters a Conquest match, the focus suddenly turns from the two teams killing each other to both teams aligning to destroy the capital ship as it slowly moves through the sector. The four-person team onboard the big ship must exit the ship and defend it against the Conquest teams. This three-way fight is one of the most interesting and creative multiplayer modes we’ve seen in a long time, and makes the overall game far more involving as a result.\\n\\nCompleting an Escape Run successfully also leads to rare items and rewards unavailable in the standard Conquest mode. Unfortunately, Dead Star only features these two modes, and feels a bit light as a result. There were also some noticeable issues with in-game lag, resulting in ships suddenly jumping around. It was a fairly minor issue overall, but enough to be annoying.\\n\\nDead Star, overall, is a fun change of pace from other multiplayer-only games. It comes with a decent tutorial and bot match options as well, but the fast and fun 10-on-10 matches are the obvious draw. The Escape Run mode is an intense and creative twist that keeps things lively. For fans of old school shooters, this is especially worth checking out.\\n\", '\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing a broken pile of nuts = the result of never-ending crunch.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot going around the internet now about Alex St. John and his espousing 80-hour work weeks as this paramount dedication to your craft.\\xa0After getting over my initial disgust and checking out the epic takedowns that resulted then\\xa0writing about it on my own blog, I was more interested in seeing the reactions from other game developers of all calibers\\xa0to this whole blowup.\\n\\nAs a financial freedom advocate for indie developers, and someone who just really loathes the whole live to work mentality that has permeated American culture as a whole, I found myself feeling mystified and saddened reading the comments of this Destructoid piece.\\xa0There were plenty more reactions I read all around the internet, with a majority rallying against crunch and working until you literally drop.

How much does the games industry in particular lose out on?\\n\\nHow many talented people curl in on themselves and give up because of burnout?\\n\\nHow many people don\\'t even give\\xa0game development a\\xa0try because of toxic environments-- or simply just the fear of ending up in one?\\n\\nThere\\'s a couple different facets to this whole thing: using passion as justification for low pay and horrific work conditions, indoctrination that your passion won\\'t pay, and a \"live to work\" culture that does no one any favors.\\n\\nPassion Isn\\'t an Excuse to Treat Someone Like a Subhuman\\n\\nIf there\\'s one very good thing that\\'s happened as a result of this op ed going around? Aside from spurring more talks about how crucial work-life balance is and how it\\'s terribly lacking in many workplaces,\\xa0it\\'s also\\xa0getting people talking about how it\\'s a terrible phenomenon that game studios and other employers who need creative talent\\xa0are notorious for not paying people a living wage because so many people are passionate about their craft and having a chance to work at it is supposed to be good enough. That if that person gets fed up with the work environment, someone else will be nipping at their heels to work hellish hours for peanuts.\\n\\nThis attitude is problematic and has led to this allover\\xa0systemic and cultural devaluation of creative skills: it\\'s why we never stop hearing things like\\xa0\"Have fun serving coffee for minimum wage with your art degree! Why didn\\'t you major in something useful like accounting?\" Yet they would be utterly clueless if they tried to make their website or branding materials look spiffy on their own time. Or have no idea what a vector is.\\n\\nThere\\'s the disrespect side, then there\\'s the expectation that creative endeavors are solely for fun and therefore not worthy of pay.\\xa0You know, the \"But won\\'t you do it for EXPOSURE!\" types. (Exposure to people who also don\\'t want to pay for your time?) The kind who espouse going on race-to-the-bottom content mills to pay $5 for work,\\xa0while wanting to charge premium prices for their end product.\\n\\nPassion is no excuse to underpay someone.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a game developer, a writer, musician, artist, some combination of the above: you should have no reservations about asking to be paid for your work. None whatsoever.\\n\\nI got a friend who teaches music lessons and does performances at weddings with other session musicians. She\\'s a hard worker with an advanced degree and a teaching license.\\xa0People have had the gall to think the band will\\xa0seriously perform for free or take payment in food,\\xa0then balk at the price tag when she tells them how much it will actually cost to hire the band for the event. When well, you\\'re paying for her years of education and training. The quality instruments she invested in. Then the simple fact that the rehearsal space for that shitty version of Canon in D Major that you want also costs money, as does renting a van to and from the venue. Payment in dinner? How nice. A mass catering pack chicken cutlet doesn\\'t pay rent or help put gas in that van.\\n\\nWhile the couple throwing the wedding isn\\'t exactly in the same boat as a publicly-traded company that makes millions, if not billions, of dollars on the backs of burnt-out creative people feeling that their passion is definitely not paying them, it\\'s a similar idea. Talented developers have invested in their skills and spent a great deal of time and money doing so.\\n\\nLook, this doesn\\'t even start and stop in creative fields. Talk to any given public school teacher about the vitriol they get during every election cycle despite how important their work is to society, and how much money and time they have to invest in their degrees, licenses, and continuing education. Then take a look at the pay for a lot of jobs in hard sciences:\\xa0many grads earn\\xa0less than the average English major.\\xa0Despite busting your hump trying to find cures to diseases, many scientists are expected to toil for this crappy pay because of PASSION just like teachers.\\n\\nOr the \"just do it on the side!\" mentality. Man, if EVERYONE worked on their passion on the side then we\\'d not only never have new games, but also no new movies, TV, books, or anything else that makes life less of an endless travail with no end in sight.\\xa0Does anyone ever suggest doing brain surgery on the side? Hmm, yet these same people would get upset if their favorite shows and game franchises just completely halted production and nothing was ever made again.\\n\\nBut Passion *Can* Pay\\n\\nI grew up during the golden age of adventure gaming and started college right after 9/11. Those games I played put a dream in me that I thought had to die by the time I was college-age and the industry was going through its awkward teenage years. Game design programs in schools? There was no such thing back then. If you wanted to go into games, your only option was to move to California or Washington then fiercely compete to get into one of these big studios just to risk being out of a job in six months anyway.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t exactly give me the impression that game development was inherently entrepreneurial unless you had access to millions of dollars and would put down roots in California.\\n\\nThings drastically\\xa0changed by the time I was done with my first degree at the height of the recession: suddenly there\\'s all these new platforms and tools for people to make games with. That people who never set foot in a AAA company before could pick up one of these tools, form a fanbase,\\xa0and actually make a living.\\n\\nNo less, I was still heavily indoctrinated into believing\\xa0that starting a business was too risky. I had zero business mentors at home or in college: wasn\\'t the purpose of putting my life on hold going to school was so I could get a good job? I figured\\xa0my passion wouldn\\'t pay. That my accounting degree would surely land a nice stable job that will allow me the time to do what I want in my spare time? To just maybe do game dev on the side?\\n\\nI did not come from a AAA background so I can\\'t talk about being in the trenches getting a multi-million dollar game out with someone else dictating my schedule. No, I suffered in the tax industry where I wound up meeting my future business partner. An industry that frequently forces its workers to work 7-day weeks during tax season (funny this all went down right before Tax Day, huh?) and is one of the biggest arbiters of wage theft right after retail and fast food-- whether it\\'s a national chain or a tiny firm-- because of the ridiculous hours you\\'re often forced to work. When I escaped the tax gulag two years ago, I had a persistent facial tic\\xa0that took almost three months to go away because I was so sleep-deprived. My blood sugar\\xa0got out of whack from both sleep deprivation and having little time to eat, and my digestive tract also took about a month to go back to normal as my appetite was also gone due to stress. Do you think ANY job is worth that? I was just doing tax returns\\xa0for wealthy Manhattanites. I wasn\\'t in there curing cancer or working on my passions. Even if I was doing one of those things, no paycheck is worth developing physical health problems one didn\\'t have before working there.\\n\\nI saw things in the tax gulag\\xa0that forever changed my views on money and life, and vowed I\\'d never give up my humanity in my quest for having the financial\\xa0freedom to make games: I expanded that to helping other indies do the same and began a second business after realizing what a huge smack in the face my old career path\\xa0was.\\n\\nI\\'m passionate about making games but also about helping other indies understand business: with consulting, teaching classes, blogging, hitting up conventions, and taking on short-term and long-term contracts with companies who want to do business with game developers but don\\'t know how to reach us.\\n\\nThere ARE ways to make your passion pay. One part of it is finding the right platforms and methods to do so. The other part of it is demanding that you be paid what you\\'re worth\\xa0and refusing to back down. When employers and clients start doling out the \"be thankful I\\'m giving you this opportunity!\" lines, RUN don\\'t walk.\\n\\n\\n\\nParticularly if you\\'re being held at banana-point while they say it.\\n\\nMaking Time For Real Life\\n\\nSo you\\'ve taken the plunge. You\\'ve gone to work for a studio or are putting your own funds in on going indie. Suddenly you don\\'t see games the same anymore.\\n\\nThe sheer amount of work that goes into making a game, let alone running a studio,\\xa0can definitely be a passion killer. There\\'s no bones about it. There are indeed people who will run away screaming when they see that the indie life isn\\'t what they thought it was going to be. If you\\'re going indie, you need to have more business acumen than if you want to work for a studio. Both are respectable paths, and deserve\\xa0to have their time and wellbeing respected. Rami Ismail really said it the best with \"Please be in the games industry if you want to make games and care. I don’t care if you want to make games for two hours every night after work or for 40 hours for a paycheck or for 80 hours as an entrepreneur. Just don’t make others pay with their health for your shitty scheduling.\"\\n\\nCrunch does no one any good. No one should be forced into 80-hour work weeks period, let alone unpaid for extra time. I\\'ll let the people who\\'ve been in AAA attest to that, I have different crunch experience as you just read and will forever advocate for a human work schedule that takes real life into account.\\n\\nBut I can speak for the indie life. Indies often swallow this \"live to work\" mantra and force said shitty scheduling onto themselves, which is problematic. Many people are indoctrinated to think that working for yourself automatically means having to go it all alone and work 80-120 hour weeks just so you can release your game as fast as humanly possible on account of having little or no income for a protracted timeframe if you\\'re going all in on the timing part. It doesn\\'t have to be this way. You can scale back. You can delegate personal, business, and development-related tasks so that you can not only make a great game but also have time for a personal life. Refusal to delegate is one of the biggest reasons businesses of all types\\xa0fail. It\\'s crucial that you make time for self-care, friends, family, community, and your life outside of game development.\\n\\nThere\\'s no Steam achievement that unlocks because you\\'re not getting enough sleep or you completely stopped having a social life\\xa0so you could spend all your nights working on your game. You don\\'t know what could happen tomorrow. The \"sacrifice everything now so you can have it all in the future!\" mindset is harmful because you don\\'t know what the future holds. It\\'s easy to be just one accident or illness away from losing everything and if you don\\'t have your health, what the hell do you have?\\xa0I also say this as someone who sacrificed my youth thinking I\\'d cash in on a nice tax advisor career, that if I just worked hard it would pay off and I could be free to make games and do whatever else I wanted. Yeah...that didn\\'t exactly pan out after the recession hit.\\n\\nEver since the National Endowment of the Arts decided to make games eligible for their grants, there\\'s been massive debate ever since about whether games or really an art or just business. If you see games as art, who the hell says you have to suffer for your art?\\n\\nCrunch needs to be abolished as does terrible work-life balance. And if you work for yourself, be kinder to yourself. We don\\'t have a lot of time on this earth. If you choose passion and are trying to make it pay, remember that there\\'s more to life than work.\\xa0If we want not just better games, but a better world to live in, the discussions need to continue\\xa0on work-life balance and valuing all labor not just business and tech labor.\\n', \"\\n\\nAfter charming the App Store with its quirky theme and great art, \\n\\n is now available on Android, too, and I suggest you go pick it up. If you don't know anything about the game, \\n\\n is the digital version of the Kickstarter-darling card game that broke many records and landed on many tables. In the game, you try to avoid finding yourself holding an Exploding Kitten card while lacking a Defuse card. If that happens, well, the poor kitty gets it. Wrong as the theme may sound (especially for a cat lover like myself), the game is really fun to play.\\n\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nAs I mentioned in my review of the iOS version (spoiler: I really liked it), the game hits the right balance between being casual and having enough complexity to keep it interesting.

My name is Niles and I’m the creative director at Nilo Studios. We’re excited to announce Asemblance, a single-player, first-person psychological thriller for PS4.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nIt’s the first episode of an expansive franchise inspired by The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and the Black Mirror television series. These series show a unique ability to pull the viewer into a narrative that isn’t always logical and keeps you engaged by asking what is really true. We’ve also found inspiration in games that allow players to explore different theories and ultimately engage one another to learn the truth. We were inspired by this approach to create a narrative where you’re never quite sure what’s real or what’s not. We hope we’ve accomplished that in Asemblance.\\n\\nWe’re just about done with development and are currently optimizing the game, polishing the audio design, and adding the final touches to the game’s multilayered narrative.\\n\\n\\n\\nNilo was founded in Seattle, Washington, just last year, so we’re a relatively new studio. That said, the developers here have years of experience making games, writing books, and producing music here in the Seattle area. I was a designer at Bungie for almost ten years before founding Nilo. While I’m proud of the work I’ve done on bigger games like Destiny, it’s incredibly exciting to start something new where we can experiment more with narrative game design.\\n\\nThanks for reading. We can’t wait to see what you think of Asemblance. Keep an eye out for more updates and feel free to post questions in the comments section below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t10 Comments\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n', 'YouTube announced that it\\'s updating its Content ID system. Upcoming changes to how content creators are affected by copyright claims aim to \"help fix that frustrating experience,\" according to\\xa0the YouTube Creator blog.\\n\\nBeginning later this year, YouTube will allow monetized videos that have been hit by third-party copyright claims to continue running ads during the dispute process. Once a resolution is reached, the revenue from those ads will go to either the original creator or opposing party. The infographic below explains how the new system will work in four steps.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of now, YouTubers who choose to monetize videos cannot earn money off them if disputing a copyright claim. Content ID claims are made by third-parties on content that uses footage or other trademarked property they say belongs to them. Thanks to the Content ID system, companies and other claimants can attempt to earn money off videos that, according to them, use their work.\\n\\nVideo creators are given the option to declare these claims invalid; doing so under the current system, however, prevents them from making money through ads on their work until a settlement is reached.\\n\\n\"We strongly believe in fair use and believe that this improvement to Content ID will make a real difference,\" the post said. \"In addition to our work on the Content ID dispute process, we\\'re also paying close attention to creators\\' concerns about copyright claims on videos they believe may be fair use.\"\\n\\nYouTube\\'s parent company Google\\xa0came under fire for the Content ID system back\\xa0in 2013. Several gaming-related videos were affected by the process, which scans through videos in search of copyrighted material and can automatically generate infringement notices for rights holders. Ad-supported networks, like Machinima, and Let\\'s Play creators were\\xa0especially affected, as their videos are largely composed of gaming content created by major companies.\\n\\n\"It\\'s certainly a step in the right direction, albeit just a step\"\\n\\nSince then, YouTube has attempted to make amends with its biggest creators. In November, the company expanded its fair use protection to include covering legal fees incurred by creators battling undue copyright claims. The company offers to pay up to $1 million on select videos, which it assesses and supports on an individual basis.\\n\\nAmong those who have benefited from the new policy are Jim Sterling, whose Jimquisition series regularly uses video game footage — which has led to him becoming embroiled in copyright claim disputes.\\n\\nThe Jimquisition videos also run ad-free, a point that Sterling notes in his latest video. Note the heavy amount of unrelated, big-name gaming content throughout the video below: There\\'s a reason for it, as Sterling explains at the end.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nSterling doesn\\'t choose to monetize his videos, but Content ID will still notify companies like Nintendo and Konami that their material is being used by unauthorized channels. That\\'s a major failing of the system, Sterling says, and it\\'s one that is easily exploited — and that he openly mocks.\\n\\nWe reached out to Sterling about the proposed changes to Content ID by email. \"It\\'s certainly a step in the right direction, albeit just a step,\" he said of how YouTube will handle monetization during disputes. \"It\\'s nice YouTube finally decided companies shouldn\\'t be allowed to effectively steal money, sometimes for literally no reason, based on an easily exploitable automated system. It does not solve the fact that the system itself is still easily abused, and it doesn\\'t stop the fact that disputed copyright claims are still accepted or rejected by the claimant itself with zero oversight from anybody else.\\n\\n\"The power is still firmly in the hands of those who have continued to ignore fair use exceptions, and I don\\'t think this will make things any easier for content creators in the long run.\"\\n\\nSterling expressed cynicism about YouTube\\'s changes, which the YouTube Creator blog cited as just some of the major investments the company is making into bettering the Content ID system. The post also mentions that Content ID charges are disputed less than 1 percent of the time, and that it has a dedicated team working to resolve and prevent falsified claims.\\n\\n\"I appreciate the gesture, but I\\'ve seen YouTube make gestures before that amounted that to a heap of shite, so I\\'m not prepared to dance a little jig in celebration of this,\" Sterling said. \"I shall, instead, continue dancing to Erasure songs in videos in order to confuse [Content ID] and ensure no one company can put ads on my videos because three of them want to at once.\"\\n', \"\\n\\nHello, gentle readers, and welcome to the RPG Reload, the weekly feature where we always seem to be starting from scratch. Each week, we take a look at an RPG from the App Store's past to see how it holds up in the futuristic, post-apocalyptic world we inhabit. It's a chance to revisit old favorites, reflect on their overall place in the iOS library, or simply to take a deeper dive than our reviews usually allow for. As the Lukahn of this little Circle Of Sages, I decide which game gets the canoe from week to week. If you feel I've missed any awesome games, however, you can make a suggestion by commenting below, posting in the Official RPG Reload Club thread, or by tweeting me at @RPGReload. While it might not show up for a while, it will be added to the master list, so you'll see it sooner or later.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Ravensword: The Fallen King [$2.99] got Crescent Moon started and Aralon: Sword And Shadow [$4.99] proved to be a wild success, the publisher's name had become synonymous with iOS RPGs. While Crescent Moon's next internally-developed RPG, Ravensword: Shadowlands [$6.99], was still quite a ways off, the publisher had started to work with other iOS developers to bring their games to market. Not all of those games would be RPGs, but many of them were. One of the more successful of the bunch was Pocket RPG [$4.99], a light action-RPG from South African developer Tasty Poison Games. It's more of a mindless hack 'n slash than the average RPG, but there's no questioning it has a certain compelling quality to it.\\n\\nTasty Poison first revealed the game on the TouchArcade forums in August of 2010, and very few of the details outlined in those first posts changed in the final game. The idea was to make a stripped-down RPG experience that was part shooter, part roguelike, and part hack-and-slash action game. Initially planned for release later that year, the game ended up needing a little more time to finish development. Crescent Moon got involved with the game in October of 2010 and offered what assistance they could to help the developers finish and market the game. Pocket RPG eventually released in July of 2011 for the iPad and around a month after that on the iPhone. The game received a relatively warm reception from critics and players alike, though there were a few bugs at launch that needed to be ironed out.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn contrast to Crescent Moon's previous RPG release Aralon, Pocket RPG was incredibly simple. You begin by selecting from one of three job classes. The Blademaster wields a weapon in each hand and is a master of melee combat. The Dark Ranger uses projectiles as a means of attack, with a play style not far off from twin-stick shooters in practice. The last character, the Battle Mage, is like a mix of the two, able to attack at a range or close up, but not as well at either as the specialist classes. You then enter a series of semi-random top-down stages spread across eight worlds where you'll smash enemies and objects in pursuit of loot and experience. Pretty standard stuff.\\n\\nWhat makes Pocket RPG a little different is that after completing each world, you lose all of that loot and experience. Wait, what? Yes, you start each new world set back to level one, naked as the day you were born. No awesome flaming sword of hacking, and all your grinding was for naught. Kind of. While your level is reset and you lose your loot, between each world you're able to pick up new permanent skills and buy some loot that may or may not appear in stages from that point forward. So while the traditional measures of RPG progress are constantly being zeroed out, you're still becoming stronger the more you play. It sounds questionable, but it ends up working really well.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the kind of experience the game is going for, breaking the game up into a series of mini-adventures works quite well. At the same time, putting in some sort of overarching character progression gives the player a sense of ownership. Indeed, the presence of a save spot for each character type seems to back up the idea that you're meant to make each of them your own, taking them out on adventures and making them a little stronger each time. The downside of this is that while your character does become stronger as you play, the loot itself starts to feel like it's all a bit throw-away. It's really frustrating to find some excellent gear knowing that you're going to lose it all soon.\\n\\nResetting the experience each time is pretty clever, though. As you play through the game, even though you start fresh on each world, you'll level up faster and faster. Each level up is not only satisfying in the aesthetic sense, it also serves the practical use of topping off your life meters. Thus, even characters devoid of any kind of innate healing ability can usually survive by the grace of rapid level-ups. From a purely psychological point of view, having the level ups come fast and furious is a clever bit of design. Much as I can appreciate the way, for example, classic Dungeons & Dragons treats its higher levels like spun gold, I suspect people generally prefer that aspect in the earlier stages, where gains come frequently and are of greater relative value. Pocket RPG puts you in a perpetual loop of getting a lot of useful level-ups.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn as far as the game aims to give players a light, easy to pick up (and put down) action-RPG experience, it achieves what it sets out to do. It's simple enough that it still works fairly well as a game even after almost five years, even if it does get more than a little repetitive in longer sessions. While it's been a few years since it's seen an update, Pocket RPG functions mostly fine on modern hardware and iOS versions. I had some sound issues here and there, but nothing that impeded gameplay. It could probably use another update at some point, if only to better support the many screen sizes that have sprung up since 2013, or perhaps add in MFi support, but you can still enjoy it as-is.\\n\\nThe iOS platform has been home to a lot of enjoyable action RPGs. Sadly, many of them are no longer on the store, but Pocket RPG is still going strong. While I'd personally take something like Ys [$4.99]\\xa0 any day of the week over this game, I can't deny that it has a lot of appeal in times where I don't feel like settling into something that requires more attention. I think, in its time, it was a great chaser for the complex Aralon, and in the here and now, it still has aspects to its design that are worth appreciating. It would be interesting to see the developers try a follow-up, but Tasty Poison strikes me as a developer that likes to stick their fingers in a variety of pies. They may never come back around to this genre again, but if they do, I'm sure at least a few RPG fans will have kept a light on for them.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nThat's just my take on Pocket RPG, though. What do you all think? I want to know, so please leave a comment below, post in the Official RPG Reload Club thread, or tweet me at @RPGReload. Be sure to tune in to the latest episode of the RPG Reload Podcast on Monday to hear Eric and me have a conversation with Josh from Crescent Moon. The talk mostly centers around Ravensword, but Pocket RPG does come up here and there. As for me, I'll be back next week with the next part of our ongoing History Of Handheld RPGs feature. Thanks for reading!\\n\\nNext Week's Reload: The History Of Handheld RPGs, Part Nine\\n\\n\\n\", 'Warner Bros.\\' upcoming The Flash movie no longer has a director. Seth Grahame-Smith is exiting the DC Comics movie, citing \"creative differences,\" sources told The Hollywood Reporter.\\n\\nThe Flash would have been Grahame-Smith\\'s directorial debut. He wrote the movies Pride & Prejudice & Zombies and Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.\\n\\nThough Grahame-Smith has left The Flash, Warner Bros. is reportedly keeping his script, which he developed after The Lego Movie\\'s Phil Lord and Christopher Miller got it started.\\n\\nThe Flash is scheduled to come to theaters on March 3, 2018, though it is unclear if Grahame-Smith exiting the project will result in a delay. Actor Ezra Miller will play The Flash AKA Barry Allen; he also plays the speedy superhero in the CW show.\\n\\nIn November 2015, it was confirmed that the Flash movie will have no connection to the TV show.\\n\\n \\n', '\\n\\nWith all the teasers and hints this past week surrounding the upcoming Call of Duty instalment, Infinity Ward is continuing the hype by releasing a behind-the-scenes video about the franchise. \\n\\nThe short video features developer interviews with narrative director Taylor Kurosaki, art director Velinda Reyes, and more. Reyes describes her favorite moment in the series being when you\\'re hanging for your life on an icy cliff in Modern Warfare 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther detail is given by sound designer Christopher Egert, who gives insight into how foley and sound effects are captured for Call of Duty. He said, \"We\\'re going to the desert to record explosions, we\\'re going to airports to record jets. It\\'s almost as intense as playing the game.\"\\n\\nTo learn more about the next Call of Duty, read up about the recent leaks, watch the trailer here, and learn how Activision is using a Facebook bot to help market the new title.\\n\\n\\n', 'When it comes to pinball games for the Wii U, there\\'s really not a whole lot of options available. Zen Pinball 2 is obviously the first name that comes to mind, and while it certainly delivers a diverse and in-depth library of tables to choose from (along with the standalone Star Wars Pinball), one occasionally must wonder what it would look like if another company took a meaningful shot at it. Enter Pinball Arcade, a title that aims to emulate the experience of dozens of real life pinball tables. While there are some slight performance issues, and the storefront could have a less confusing setup for buying tables, Pinball Arcade does a remarkable job of capturing the spirit of the tables it emulates and preserving their legacy.\\n\\nWhile we weren\\'t huge fans of the setup of Zen Pinball 2\\'s means of acquiring tables (it was the first of its kind on the eShop, to be fair), the structure has come a long way since. All tables in Pinball Arcade are available in-game and are divided up into \"seasons\" of about a dozen tables each. You can try every table before buying, with the demo cutting off once you reach a reasonably judged score threshold, and you\\'re able to then buy the table individually or as part of a pack, depending on the table. It\\'s painless and straightforward, though things are complicated much more when you factor in Pro Versions.\\n\\nEvery table also has a \"Pro Version\" which is a few dollars more, but gives you access to operator controls, ball control, pro tips and more. The extra content being offered really seems to justify the higher cost, though the value may not seem worth it to everybody. Farsight Studios obviously wants to push Pro Versions more, so a discount is offered if you by the Pro Version right off the bat. This creates a sort of in-game fragmentation that may grow confusing the more tables you buy.\\n\\nThe confusion stems from the plethora of discounts and bundles that are offered, some of which may seem conflicting. For example, say you own six tables in a season. Four of those tables are the Pro Versions and three of those Pro Versions were upgraded after you bought the vanilla version. Now suppose you\\'d like to buy the rest of the games in the season and you\\'d like to buy the bundle, but you already own half of the tables, and you want to buy Pro Versions for only two of the tables you don\\'t have. At the end of it all, you may be left wondering if you could\\'ve paid less money for the tables you bought. It\\'s not that it\\'s hard to download the tables that you want, but it\\'s not always made entirely clear if you\\'re paying the least amount of money to do so, and this could be better communicated on the storefront.\\n\\nAll the same, once you have the tables you want it\\'s a remarkable experience. Every table has been painstakingly constructed based on a real world equivalent, and the attention to detail is delightful. All of the original dot matrix screens and sound bites are recreated perfectly, and the extra content surrounding the history of each table is a nice plus. Upon starting up any table for the first time you\\'ll be treated to a paragraph detailing the design, popularity and total units sold, and there are scans of the original flyers for several tables hidden away in the game\\'s menu. If you buy the Pro Version you can also read through detailed guides written by pinball professionals that will help you to maximize your scores, and you can even buy custom balls for 99 cents each (US) that can be used on any tables. All this extra content adds a lot to the experience, and makes it very evident that the developers spent a lot of time doing their homework.\\n\\nAs for the gameplay itself, it\\'s not always perfect but it certainly is a whole lot of fun. Try as they might, the developers haven\\'t quite managed to nail that exact feel of how a real world pinball bounces about the machine, but it gets it very close. The action remains smooth and fast paced for the most part, though some of the more complex tables will see the framerate experience some slowdown. It\\'s never enough to interrupt the experience but it\\'s noticeable when it happens, and it feels like something that could\\'ve been absent from the final release.\\n\\nOf course, the tables being offered are the real stars of the show, and the selection is extremely varied and diverse. Two to three decades\\' worth of tables are available, featuring just about every theme you could imagine. Naturally, there\\'s maturation in the complexity of the machines according to the year of release; some of the earliest machines don\\'t even feature a dot matrix display, and they continue to get deeper and more RPG-like the more recent they get. Regardless of the age of the machines, all of them offer exhilarating arcade action and are well worth their asking prices.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that would like just a little bit more of replayability, there\\'s a challenge mode to give these tables a little more longevity. Here, you\\'ll be tasked with a variety of missions that challenge you to hit a certain score threshold, increase your score a certain amount between balls, or complete a specific objective. Sure, it\\'s still the same basic pinball action, but it puts a different twist on things that make them all the more engaging.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nUltimately, Pinball Arcade is an excellent representation of classic pinball machines from over the years. The tables are generally very well designed, there\\'s a broad array of options to choose from, and the replayability is virtually unlimited. Barring some performance issues and a hokey means of buying tables in bulk, this is pinball at its finest. We\\'d strongly recommend you pick this one up, there\\'s something here for everybody and it\\'s pure arcade magic.\\n', 'Beta tests can be\\xa0an important step in the video game development process since it provides\\xa0developers with bug detection as well as feedback on design and operational readiness in a real world environment.

For one, new video game consoles -- from all manufacturers -- are often sold at a loss during their launch period.\\xa0\\n\\nCase in point: The Wii U, Nintendo\\'s current hardware, was. In an investor Q&A from 2014, late president Satoru Iwata refers to \"the loss arising due to the hardware production costs being higher than our trade price.\"\\n\\nThis flies in the face of Nintendo\\'s longtime hardware design philosophy, as credited to the late Gunpei Yokoi, most notably the hardware lead on the original Game Boy. He coined the phrase \"lateral thinking with withered technology,\" which refers to using low-cost, mature tech in products, and the company has used this philosophy in\\xa0many of its successful hardware devices.\\n\\nKimishima also refers to exchange rates. To use his words from the company\\'s investor briefing: North America is \"Nintendo\\'s largest market.\" That means that exchange rates are of particular notability to its business.\\xa0\\n\\nExchange rate shifts allowed the company to swing back to profits in 2015; a strong yen caused the company\\'s stock to slide in 2010.\\xa0\\n\\nIf the yen continues to hold at a rate favorable to Nintendo\\'s business, that could result in a rosier launch for the NX than the Wii U saw, regardless of if it sells much better. Kimishima was cagey about divulging company expectations for NX sales at the investor meeting; the console is due to launch worldwide in March 2017.\\n', \"If you don't pay attention to the PC/console world, chances are you've missed out on 2K's latest blockbuster release, Battleborn. The easiest way to describe it is if you took Borderlands, added some elements which almost feel MOBA-like, mixed in a bunch of different characters kind of like Blizzard's Overwatch, and gave all of them their own guns and abilities. Here's the launch trailer which gives you an idea of how that all goes together:\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nWell, the mobile companion game launched this morning as well. It's called Battleborn Tap [Free] and it somewhat predictably distills what 2K is aiming for in Battleborn into a super-simple party based tap to attack kind of game. Here's what it looks like in motion:\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nIt seems like the main reason to play Battleborn Tap is to unlock rewards in Battleborn proper. For instance, just by downloading the game and linking your 2K SHiFT account you'll be able to get a fancy schmancy Orendi skin. Play a bit longer, and you'll get other exclusive rewards for the full version of the game. I'm always a sucker for these kind of exclusive skin things, so, I'll be tappin' away today.\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nJust as the first game did a few years ago, Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 [Free] has grabbed a lot of my attention since its release not long ago. It's a little buggy in places, but the turn-based battle system is very satisfying and strategic, and the team-building offers a lot of options to support a variety of play styles. Plus, it has Spider-Man in it. So, since I'm playing the game an awful lot anyway, I thought I'd put together a bit of advice for anyone else who might be interested in the game. Note that I'm going to try to keep away from recommending specific characters, since an overpowered character is often one update away from being toned down.\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nThe game will walk you through most of its systems, and no matter what, you'll get Hawkeye as a team member. You might think he's a useless character just because he's free, but he's actually quite powerful in the right party build, so don't feel guilty about beefing him up. As useful as Hawkeye is for dealing damage, however, he's no tank. The game will give you a free hero draw, and who you get from that will determine your course. If you get a tank, you're all set. Otherwise, you're going to need to rely on friend assists until you can pull one. The gold flows relatively quickly early on, so you should be able to get a tanking character before too long.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly on, you'll want to focus on clearing out at least the first set of campaign missions on normal difficulty. This will help you fill out your team and power sets, and will put you well on your way towards getting your Commander Rank high enough to unlock the game's other features. How much you want to dally in PVP and the Spec Ops missions is up to you, but no matter what, you'll want to get access to the Scouting missions as soon as you can. There are items that can only be collected in Scouting missions that you'll need to advance your characters past level 9.\\n\\nThe game will give you a limited time offer for a starter set that includes Spider-Man and some other goodies. If you really love Spider-Man and don't care about spending some money, you can go for it. Realistically, Spider-Man's not *that* great, and you'll likely pull him sooner or later anyway, so my recommendation is to pass on it.\\n\\nBuilding Your Team\\n\\nLike a lot of other free-to-play RPGs, there are tons of characters to collect, but you certainly don't need all or even most of them. Having more characters is a benefit in as much as it allows you to make minute adjustments according to the current situation. It's far more important to build one solid team of five members before anything else, however. Here are some general tips for making that happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nChoose a tank. You won't get far in Avengers Alliance 2 without a tank of some sort in your active party. Some people like to keep a spare tank on the bench, but if you've set things up right, it shouldn't be necessary. The best tanks are heroes of the Bruiser (blue) and Tactician (green) type, but certain characters in those groups fare better than others. Make sure your prospective tank has a move that can generate the Protect status, and load them up with Iso-8 that either buff up their defense (if a Bruiser type) or evasion (if a Tactician type). If you don't have a suitable character, you'll have to depend on the kindness of strangers to provide.\\n\\nMake sure you have someone who can hit Stealth-status characters. As long as a character has an attack that deals damage to all targets, you'll be able to damage a Stealth-mode opponent. You can also accomplish this by equipping sets of Iso-8 on a character, but we'll go more into that later on. If you don't have a character capable of this, you might end up in a dire pinch.\\n\\nDon't underestimate buffs and debuffs. It's tempting to just let fly with your strongest attackers, and in some situations, that's the right way to go. But long battles go smoother if you have some choice buffs or debuffs among your moves. Ideally, it's great if your tank has these moves, but you certainly shouldn't be shy about equipping them on other characters, too. They're more powerful than most people seem to realize.\\n\\nThink carefully about how your team is going to work together. For example, you generally don't need two characters who can generate the Protect status, so if you want to include a character beyond your tank who has a move like that, make sure to replace it with something else before jumping into battle. Watch for opportunities to generate extra attacks, such as combining Hawkeye's Overwatch skill with a tank using a Protect move. Think about what each character's role in the party is going to be and equip them appropriately.\\n\\n\\n\\nEquip the right Iso-8. At first, you're not going to have much of a selection to work with, but believe me, you'll be swimming in the stuff before too long. Iso-8 boosts stats and if you equip enough of the same type, will confer some sort of special passive ability to the character. You'll want to consider both of these things. An evade tank can certainly use more evasion, and a regeneration status can help heal any hits that do land. An attacker obviously benefits from higher speed and attack power, but you'll also want to keep your eyes open for useful perks like being able to target Stealthed or Protected opponents. That said, while passive skills are useful, big stat gains in vital areas are more important.\\n\\nDon't be lazy about building up your benchwarmers, either. Although you can only bring two or three characters into active battle with you at any one time, you can have two or three others (depending on the mode) sitting on the sidelines, ready when you need them. At first, you probably won't need them too often, but as you take on higher difficulty missions, every member counts. Don't neglect them just because they're not part of your active party.\\n\\nPowering Up Your Team\\n\\nYou've got your party, now you just need to get them in fighting shape. The best way to do that is to gain levels by fighting battles, because levels are significant in this game. That said, there are a lot of things you can do to make the process easier. Here are some tips.\\n\\n\\n\\nFind a team and stick with it. As tempting as it is to play with new toys as soon as you get them, unless you see them doing a job better than someone already on your team, it's best to leave them aside until you get one solid group up to the max level of 30. With one decent maxed-out team, you will be more easily able to gather what you need for the next team you want to raise. It can't hurt to have spares, of course, but five characters at level 30 beats ten characters at level 15 no matter how you measure it.\\n\\nGet started on Hero Trials as soon as possible. That means level 10 for all one-star characters and abilities. Most of the required trials are things you're going to be doing anyway, so if you open them up and start them as early as possible, you'll likely finish most of them on the way. Granted, opening them requires the correct resources, but if you have them, use them. The benefits of raising a star level are huge.\\n\\nUse up your unstable Iso as soon as you get it. There's no downside to doing this. Typically pour them into whoever is your strongest character of the matching type, and use rainbow ones to level up whoever on your main team is lagging behind the rest. There are good reasons to keep your group around the same levels if you can swing it.\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you shouldn't buy specific abilities. You have the option to use your ability points (the purple ones) to buy any abilities you haven't managed to pull randomly yet. This is not a great idea, in my opinion. Those points are better served for opening up trials. After you've got everyone's trials unlocked, then you can pick up any missing moves, but you'll likely have already gotten them from your many random power pulls anyway. Feel free to break this rule if you see an ability that would bring your whole team together, I suppose.\\n\\nStart running Scouting missions as soon as you can. The energy consumed for these missions recovers at an absolutely glacial rate, and might just be one of the few timers where it's not a bad idea to throw some gold at refilling it here and there. You absolutely need the resources dropped from these missions to advance your characters and therefore to advance through the game. That means if your energy points are sitting there full, you're wasting valuable time. Clearing out Scouting missions should be high on your list of priorities each time you play.\\n\\nGeneral Tips\\n\\nThe best way to learn the game is to just keep on playing, but I've thought of a few things I wish I had known from the start. It would have made things a little better for me in the long run. Some of these are obvious to veteran players, but everyone starts somewhere, right? Here are some general bits of advice.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter your first week of playing, you'll be able to choose an Avenger from a small selection. Now, depending on what kinds of characters you already have, your best choice here will differ. If you somehow still need a tank, the Tactician Captain America you can get here will certainly serve your needs. Black Widow is a devastating attacker, even after being toned down a bit, and both Thor and Hulk can be very powerful with the right set-up, particularly in PVP. I'd pass on Iron Man. Over time he eventually outpaces Hawkeye, but by the time you hit that point, you'll likely have already pulled him from your regular draws.\\n\\nDo your daily tasks. Obvious advice, but seriously. This will keep a steady flow of gold coming in that you can use for a lot of different things. Those tasks will also give you at least one Scouting mission's worth of points and a few crystal and power pulls. Better still, they're usually connected to things you are doing anyway, so it's not like it's a lot of trouble to finish them.\\n\\nComplete campaign tasks to unlock new characters and other rewards. To do this, you'll have to beat a full chapter on all difficulty levels, among other tasks. The characters you earn from this probably won't be replacing anyone on your team, but the rewards of the journey itself make it worthwhile. The same goes for Spec Ops, where you can unlock some strong characters and a lot of other great rewards by completing tasks. Note that completing the missions themselves is not the same as clearing out tasks. You'll have to check the tasks and see exactly what you need to do for each.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe weekends are a good time to load up on Silver. You might feel like you have plenty of it early on, but the farther in you get, the more you'll be consuming. You can make some quick Silver by selling excess Iso-8 crystals, but don't forget about the weekend Scouting missions. You'll rack up a bunch of Silver in a very short time by running those, and they come around every weekend.\\n\\nDon't hoard your gold as you might in other games. The daily tasks ensure you have a steady trickle coming in, and since you don't need to have more heroes than it takes to build one good team, you don't necessarily have to conserve it to use for special pulls. I wouldn't be using it for extra spins on the mission rewards or anything, but if you want to use it to refill your Scouting mission points or to continue on a particularly tough mission, I'm not going to judge you. But if you're not using it for anything else, you might as well take a try at the 25-gold draw. If nothing else, you might get some new powers or ability points for powering up your current team.\\n\\nChange your party leader. Even if you're keeping Hawkeye in your active party, you should probably move him out of the leader position. You'll earn Silver if other players choose your character to assist them, and if you don't change your leader, you're just another one of a million Hawkeyes. Powerful tanks and damage-dealers make popular choices for the spot, as most players can use one or the other.\\n\\nThat's all the advice I've got right now for Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2. I might come back to put together something more advanced later, particularly dealing with PVP. With balancing in a constant state of flux, though, I'm not sure how useful that might be. If nothing else, these tips will help you get on your way.\\n\\n\\n\", 'Powers: The Story Continues, Exclusive Look at Season 2\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPosted by John Koller on May 03, 2016 // Vice President, PlayStation Brand Marketing, SCEA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second season of the PlayStation Original series Powers is quickly approaching, and we can’t wait for you to watch the premiere.

If the vessel dies, so does she, so the angel will aim all of the vessel's shots. The vessel just has to pull the trigger and keep from getting hurt using an array of acrobatic moves as she blasts her monstrous opponents.\\n\\nThe more successful you are at Seraph, the harder its enemies get, though, so players will find themselves constantly challenged in the procedurally-generated levels. The game also features Twitch integration that will let viewers add positive or negative modifiers, so if the game seems too hard or easy, maybe some strangers on the internet will help you out. Maybe. Probably not, but maybe.\\n\\nVIDEO\\n\\nSeraph is available for $12.99 on Steam Early Access and Humble Bundle.

Several new features are going to be in the game that are set to change the game up. A new dash ability will allow you to escape some hairy situations by double-tapping the Thrust button, but it consumes one ammo, so be careful. That is, unless you enable the unlimited dash modifier, which doesn't use ammo, but comes with increased cooldown. If you don't want powerups, which is a requested feature for tournament play, then you can now disable powerups. Three new maps, including a Bomberman-inspired level with conveyor belts that loop around, will be in this new update on Thursday as well.\\n\\nView post on imgur.com\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you've been a fan of the iPad version of Astro Duel but have missed out on the iPhone-as-controller support since the Joypad app no longer was available, then good news: The Astro Remote [Free] app for the Apple TV version now works for the iPad. Prop up that big ol' iPad and engage in some astro duels with your friends without needing to get uncomfortably close to each other around the iPad screen.

In Greed Mode players face increasingly difficult waves of enemies, but are given a chance to stop each wave - and receive less goodies - by standing on a \"stop button\". The more waves you tackle without hitting the button, the greater the reward. There\\'s even better bonuses awarded for not taking damage.  \\n\\n\"Greed Mode will feel like a totally new experience that will not only yield tons of rewards for completing it with each character, but also features a very unique ending that should have you coming back,\" said Tyrone Rodriguez, the developer behind this PS4 port at Nicalis.\\n\\nAnother major new addition included in Afterbirth is Daily Runs. These make it so everyone gets the exact same dungeon (as the main game is procedurally-generated), with the same power-ups in the same locations. They also force players to all use the same character, regardless of whether you\\'ve unlocked them in the main game. Daily Runs will have their own unique leaderboards, so you can compare your run with friends. The only downside to these is that they won\\'t unlock any progress-based rewards like new characters and items for the main game.\\n\\nThere will also be new alternate levels, meaning there\\'s a chance a stage will be on fire or contain harder variations of enemies. These random stages will be more challenging, but also yield greater rewards.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n\\nThe real question is: What would happen if video game power-up got mixed-up and thrown into the wrong game?

Whether it’s art, audio, code, scripting, or some combination thereof, I\\'m sharing my tips, tricks, and insights as the former Content Curator of the Unreal Engine Marketplace to give you and your company ideas for marketing, and how to be a developer\\'s developer. This is not a self-sustaining career for everyone, but I\\'ll show you what I\\'ve learned so you can decide if this makes sense for you or your company.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOver the last few years, online marketplaces for content created by developers for developers have emerged as an increasingly viable option for independent game developers to prototype and develop their projects. This saves them thousands of dollars commissioning work from other developers, and also thousands of hours learning new peripheral skills that distract from simply prototyping and executing on their ideas. Inspiration strikes quickly and ultimately it’s about the end product. Having access to low-cost content and tools built by professionals is a valuable resource. I\\'ll show you how to benefit from that as an indie developer, a content creator, a contractor, or any combination thereof.\\n\\nFrom sellsword to selling swords\\n\\nOver the last few years, many developers have started selling content that they develop for fun and turned it into a lucrative sideline. It’s a dramatic shift away from making money as either a full-time employee or a work-for-hire contractor. Selling components of a game as a product instead of a service is a very exciting and different way to develop games, especially with engine costs approaching zero. Many of them have actually become so successful at it that they’ve been able to leave their fulltime jobs and live on the income they generate. Again, they are in the vast minority on this, but it is starting to happen, and it\\'s worth paying attention to. Whether or not you go down that path yourself, it can benefit you to be aware of people that do, because their efforts can benefit you and your projects.\\n\\nWhat do I want to sell?\\n\\nWhat’s your skillset? Artist, designer, scripter, coder, musician, or some blend thereof? Let’s start there.\\n\\nYour junk drawer isn’t hot product\\n\\nFirst, cast aside any idea that you can take old content you have laying around and can quickly flip it for cash. That’s the wrong mindset. Rummaging through your junk drawer to make a quick buck only fulfills your needs. And don’t think you can just crank out something simple in a single weekend and sell that. Your best chance for succeeding in this is developing content that fulfills the needs of other game developers, and this requires planning, research, and forethought. Being a developer yourself will give you some valuable insights into that, but you’re developing products for a large-scale audience, and that must always be kept in mind.\\n\\nFocus on your strengths\\n\\nStart from a position of strength. Don\\'t learn a completely new skillset to compete in a market already full of experts in that skill. That\\'s a frustrating uphill battle and not worth your time. To keep yourself motivated and encouraged enough to see this through, focus on creating something using your strongest skillset. The creative challenge is \"how do I design this to save the time of a large number of developers?\"\\n\\nIs there a market for this?\\n\\nPeople purchase content based on their passions and ambitions and the things that inspire and influence them. When they shop for content, they think of the pieces they need to assemble into the type of product they want. People first decide on the type of game they want to develop, and the first thing they seek is a \"starter kit\" for that type. The most popular type of product I\\'ve seen are prototype kits to fit specific game types. For example, kits for an RTS, RPG, FPS, tower defense, endless runner, and so on. After their prototype is at minimum functionality is when they look for art and audio. These markets are surprisingly large and are a great opportunity for independent content developers.\\n\\nPopular themes and trends\\n\\nIn early 2015, I saw a spike in Minecraft-style crafting, survival, horror, and zombies. Each tied into the hot property of the moment, offset by the weeks it took to develop the content after the inspiration. People would create a set of props designed for survival games. Another example is a Blueprint-based crafting system for either Minecraft or survival games. Others created horror-themed audio packs, modular zombies, animated blood splatters, etc. The creators analyzed the games, reduced them to modular components, then designed content to mix and match.\\n\\nPick a niche\\n\\nPick your genre, theme, style, and platform. You can\\'t be all things to all people. If you\\'re not sure where to start, look at what the top selling games are in the last year. Then research what the biggest upcoming games are, based on press coverage and hype. Here\\'s a sampling of games:\\n\\nPopular games and styles\\n\\nFallout 4. First-person RPG, realistic post-apocalyptic, next-gen platforms.\\n\\nMadden NFL 16. Sports, realistic, next-gen platforms.\\n\\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 3. First person shooter, realistic war game, next-gen platforms.\\n\\nLegend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Third person RPG, stylized\\\\cartoony fantasy, Nintendo console.\\n\\nHalo 5: Guardians. First person shooter, realistic sci-fi, next-gen platform.\\n\\nGran Turismo. Third person racing game, realistic, next-gen platform.\\n\\nSuper Smash Brothers Brawl. 3D fighting game\\\\brawler, cartoony, Nintendo console.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft. Third-person RPG, cartoony fantasy, PC.\\n\\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Third-person RPG, semi-realistic fantasy, next-gen consoles.\\n\\nMinecraft. First person world-builder, cartoony retro, current-gen consoles and PC.\\n\\nSelect your audience\\n\\nThis is a reasonable spread of the art styles and types of games that move a lot of units. These are the kinds of games that get the most attention from people at a broad level. They set trends that aspiring independent developers will emulate for their own projects. However, most of these are big-budget AAA productions. Customers seeking themed content inspired by these trends are usually small teams with modest budgets. It\\'s important to factor that in, and to stay in touch with what\\'s going on in the indie game dev community. Keep an eye on those trends, ebbs, and flows.\\n\\nUnderstand the indie games market and its trends. Follow indie game dev websites to see what\\'s popular. What are people building? How do the games review? Identify gaps that need filling. Look for ways to simplify repeatable processes, especially if they\\'re annoying. Finding annoying problems and solving them is a great way to win the hearts and dollars of potential customers. Bonus points if your product or description is worded in such a way that it can get favorable search rankings when people are looking to solve that type of problem.\\n\\nOne excellent resource to find out what people are playing and what developers are creating is www.steamspy.com. That is a gold mine of information to help you market and design products. Write it down now. It\\'s one of those things that\\'s so amazing, you can\\'t believe it actually exists.\\n\\nKeep an eye on geek culture\\n\\nIt’s also well worthwhile to tune into other forms of media and geeky culture. Is there a major movie, TV, or comic book release coming in the next few months? Something big, like an Aliens sequel, a new Avengers movie, the new season of Daredevil, the TV adaptation of Preacher, or really any other influential, beloved property that’s going to land in the coming months. Even science can be exciting and drive sales. When I was running the Unreal Engine Marketplace, I saw a massive spike in space-themed content of all types after NASA started showing off the high-res closeup photographs of Pluto. Tying in your product to something reminiscent of that need or that ties into it meaningfully could be a good way to drive interest and sales. Follow indie game dev websites, see what’s popular, see what people are building, and analyze your competition to see how well that need is being filled.\\n\\nReduce the games to components\\n\\nPick apart the games and think of what types of components they\\'re made up of. For example, Fallout 4 is an RPG. An RPG has various systems that can be reduced into modular component parts, NOT counting art and audio:\\n\\ncharacter creation (visual customization + UI)\\n\\ncombat (weapon types, enemy types, damage, etc)\\n\\narmor (defense bonuses, etc)\\n\\nweapons (damage bonuses, weapon modding, etc)\\n\\nXP \\\\ leveling\\n\\nvendors (buy\\\\sell\\\\repair)\\n\\nminimap (tracking agiainst real map, fog of war, etc)\\n\\nspeech and branching dialogue systems\\n\\nquests (quest givers, and ties into XP\\\\leveling, speech, etc)\\n\\nAI (NPC and enemy)\\n\\nstealth\\n\\nlocking\\\\unlocking doors\\n\\nEach of these is a modular component that has been turned into at least one product. If you have a particular skill set that can develop one of these, take a look at the market and examine the precedents. What can you do better? How well does it review?\\n\\nHow do I build it?\\n\\nAfter you’ve picked a market and a niche to fill, spend time thinking about not only how end users are going to ultimately use your content to build their games, but also how it can fit together with other pieces of content. At Epic, I created lists of products that worked well when used together to help promote content. It helped connect creators, and gave them ideas for comarketing and collaboration. Not everyone needs to be a competitor.\\n\\nFor example, this is a list of content you can use to build a fully functional third person multiplayer shooter for less than $500:\\n\\nGameplay: Generic Shooter. This Blueprint system will help you flesh out all your FPS\\'s basic systems.\\n\\nLevel prototyping: SuperGrid. This is a level prototyping kit for laying out full levels and gameplay.\\n\\nPlayer character:Military Character Silver.  Here\\'s a soldier character rigged to the default Unreal skeleton. You can use any Marketplace animation set with this!\\n\\nAnimations:Rifle Animset Pro.  Professional motion captured animation for all movement associated with two-handed weapons. Apply this to your military character above!\\n\\nWeapons:Weapon Pack: Assault Rifles.  This is a set of randomizable procedurally-generated combat rifles for your soldier.\\n\\nEnvironment art:Urban Construction Pack.  This is a well-desgined set of modular props to flesh out urban city levels with after prototyping with SuperGrid.\\n\\nVFX:Bullet VFX Pack.  Add these pre-made bullet FX to bring your weapons to life as you take it from others! This contains FX for bullets hitting metal, brick, concrete, ice, flesh, and more.\\n\\nSound effects:Universal Sound FX.  This is a great variety pack of audio to add a broad range of basic sound effects.\\n\\nMusic: Blockbuster Tension + Action Music Pack.  After all, you need good music!\\n\\nTo tie it all together, add a modular UI system and frontend.\\n\\nHow do I price it?\\n\\nHere\\'s the tricky question! Setting a price on content to sell on a marketplace is fundamentally different than setting a price for contract art services. One is a product, and one is a service. You sell services once, you sell a product as many times as you can. Commissioning a character might take 40 days at USD $200 per day, but you\\'re not going to sell that on a marketplace for the $8000 it cost. Most people buying content don\\'t know the price of these services or the labor involved. To be realistic, someone with an indie budget might balk at spending even $100 for it.\\n\\nThere are a wide variety of factors in how you decide on a price to set. The first and best way, of course, is to look at what other people charge. That\\'s your baseline. The second way is to put yourself in your customers\\' shoes as they try to decide if it\\'s a good price or not. All they have to go on is your presentation materials and the price. So they ask themselves: \"How many and at what price?\"\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking at a pack of props, for example, 100 props for $20 averages out to $0.20 per prop. Not bad! But 10 high-quality PBR rocks for $80 is $8 per rock, and that\\'s 40x more per prop. What about a set of 3 background mountains for $125? Geez, that\\'s $41.66 per mountain, this is getting expensive!\\n\\nI\\'m sure you\\'re thinking that this is a comparison of apples and oranges. And to you, it is. There are massive variables including quality, texture resolution, polygon count, modularity, and much more. You also know exactly how long it took to develop, but that doesn\\'t matter to anyone but you. To the consumer, unit price will be the first consideration. Fortunately, you can still work with that.\\n\\nThe next question the consumer asks is \"how much can I do with it?\" This is where you differentiate yourself from the competition and justify the price you set. People love knobs, dials, controls, and customization.\\n\\nHow do I convey value?\\n\\nThe best answer I’ve found is to illustrate the value by showing how you can save time by compounding effort. “With this set of 50 modular cave pieces with randomized materials, you can create thousands of possible cave configurations in minutes. Just click to draw, and flip these switches and see what you get!” People love modularity, randomization, sliders, swappable parts, and procedural generation.\\n\\nThe sales pitch there is giving someone the tools to create almost anything they can imagine for the game of their genre. That’s harder to quantify and harder to put a price on, so if you can start out with a basic number of modular parts or bullet points that they’ll do the basic “how many and at what price” math on, you can increase the price even more beyond that by adding the procedural and customization options, as well as making it *really* easy to use. Adding tutorials, documentation, and demo levels is also a confidence booster if your content is expensive.\\n\\n“I want to make caves with dungeons — oh wow, this pack is $85, but I could make thousands of them with this. It comes with 40 walls, 16 kinds of stalactites and stalagmites, and includes a demo level showing how it all fits together. I’m sold!”\\n\\nReally, how much should it cost?\\n\\nWith all of the above in mind, the best way to determine cost is still to examine your competition\\'s pricing, and to simply ask people in the community for their input. Ultimately, it\\'s all completely subjective, and there are some advantages to be found by including polling on price with your community outreach and marketing efforts.\\n\\nFrom what I\\'ve seen across all the different online marketplaces I know, my work with these communities, and from content creators themselves, the following is a rough summary of favorable price points: As for actual dollar amounts, impulse purchases can be almost anything $30 and under. If you set a price above $50, include a well-produced video to demonstrate your content. Think of it as a short commercial. Invest effort into it and make it look clean and polished. Convincing people to spend more than $50 requires more effort, and a good video is a powerful sales tool. More on that in the next section.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, anything above $50 should have more supporting content. A short commercial, video tutorials, written documentation, and ongoing support threads increase buyer confidence. If you keep the buyer\\'s confidence high and engage with your customers, you can justify higher price points.\\n\\nAnything priced from free to $5 is often considered to be low value or bad. I would recommend always pricing your content at least $10 or above. The perception is that cheap\\\\free means low quality. If it looks good but is cheap, people will wonder what\\'s wrong with it. That\\'s why it\\'s important not to price your content too low. You can always lower the price later to increase perceived value, but never the other way around. \"This $5 pack is now $25? What gives? I\\'m not buying cheap garbage!\" People are very sensitive to that. Don\\'t make your product look cheap, and don\\'t immediately limit your profitability and brand yourself as the person that makes cheap content.\\n\\nFinally, remember that anything you sell in European countries is going to have an additional ~23% Value Added Tax (VAT) added to the price. The exact value varies country by country, but it\\'s usually around this level. Look it up to be certain. Keep this in mind when setting your prices, and be prepared to answer a lot of questions about it.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve done all this and are still not sure, again, ask your audience!\\n\\nWhat makes a good video?\\n\\nKeep it between 90 and 120 seconds long. Ease of use and the end product are what is most important. Begin with examples of the finished product, then show your content in the editor. Show the controls and options you provide. Demonstrate the most useful and visually interesting configuration options your content offers. Remember that this is just a commercial to sell your content, not a tutorial video. Long tutorial videos are a must if your content is complex, and they add value. However, it is not a substitution for a commercial. On its own, a lengthy tutorial is a terrible sales tool for most people. Think of it this way: the commercial sells the product, and the tutorial is the product instruction manual.\\n\\nDazzle them with video of how it could work, then show them what knobs they can turn to use it. Try to keep it under two minutes, and you\\'ll be in a strong competitive position. The easier it is for the buyer to visualize \"what is it? Now how can I do it?\" the faster you\\'ll get them interested.\\n\\nFinally, having a lengthy tutorial video can help convince the more cost-conscious, technically-minded prospective customers. For that limited subset of your customer base, a tutorial is essentially a supplemental sales tool. For the rest of your customer base, it\\'s valuable documentation, and it\\'s seen as added value whether or not they actually use it. That\\'s an important point: Sometimes the feature that makes the sale isn\\'t even a feature they\\'ll use. It\\'s still equally important.\\n\\nHow do I build a loyal user base?\\n\\nLive where you sell. Join the forums where creators like you hang out. This is a good place for potential customers to shop around for content that\\'s in development.\\n\\nWhen dealing with potential customers on the forums, be responsive. Create a dedicated support email address, and a support thread on the forums where you sell. Interact with the community, make friends, answer questions, be respectful, and listen. You won\\'t always have answers that will satisfy. That\\'s fine. The simple act of responding and listening is important for building customer relationships.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to know that for every person that responds to you, there are ten that are lurking. It\\'s easy to make or break a reputation based on how you interact with people in public. Pay attention to how you\\'re perceived when interacting on forums. Always treat others the way you\\'d like to be treated. It\\'s good general philosophy, and people also make purchasing decisions based on the behavior they observe.\\n\\nJoin forums\\n\\nGet invites to Slack and Skype chats\\n\\nFind or create a Twitter list for interesting or influential people and interact with them there\\n\\nJoin Facebook groups\\n\\nDon\\'t lurk. Interact in a positive way. Encourage people, be positive, give constructive feedback when requested, and support those around you. Always add value.\\n\\nEmbed yourself and publicize\\n\\nEmbed yourself with other content creators. It\\'s a great way to find potential collaboration and comarketing partners. Go where they go, and emulate them. Get involved with other creators in your community and surround yourself with them. Making friends that work toward the same goals you have is a great way to stay motivated and interested. You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. This also puts you in the position to discover opportunities as they arise, either for yourself or others.\\n\\nCreate ongoing development threads for your content. It\\'s a great way to build publicity in advance of your content releases. You can also receive valuable input and feedback from other creators and potential customers. Engagement is a strong differentiator, both before your content releases and after.\\n\\nAnalyze other creators’ work\\n\\nAnalyze your competition. What works? What doesn\\'t? What are the most common complaints on forums? What do people identify as being positive? These are valuable data points for positioning both your product and customer support efforts.\\n\\nLook for other creators whose content complements yours. Always keep an eye out for potential collaborators, because you can help promote each others\\' work. Every competitor is a potential future partner. Their value as a content creator is equal to their power of their network and reach.\\n\\nAnalyze your competitors\\' content through the lens of a potential customer, not as a competitor. Content that may seem mediocre on the surface may be valuable and widely loved. At the same time, content you think is amazing may be difficult to work with and widely loathed. This is where reviews and public feedback are crucial: people are communicating what is valuable to them and worth spending money on.\\n\\nAnother strong differentiator is the quality of support the developer provides, if any. Do they consistently update their content with bug fixes? How do they interact with their community? Are they deeply involved, or do they view content development as a dumping ground? I\\'ve seen smart creators crush their competition by being responsive and offering better support, even if the quality is lower. People feel more comfortable buying content from people they like and believe will support them, even if they\\'re only spending $30.\\n\\nSet up a support structure\\n\\nSet up a separate email address and an online support system for all support requests. Here\\'s a list of support ticket software from least to most expensive:\\n\\nThese are all viable options for tracking your support requests. This is important: stay on top of customer support. It\\'s not optional. This is how you build a good reputation. Word of mouth is everything, and these are simple and cheap ways to stay organized. This is something I hammered on Marketplace sellers to maintain. I\\'ve even removed content from the Marketplace for people that wouldn\\'t support their products. This has a direct effect on sales, loyalty, and repeat customers.\\n\\nIf you cannot personally handle customer service, or have someone in a dedicated role to handle it for you, don\\'t sell content online. After quality, providing good customer service is going to be the biggest differentiator that makes you stand out in the crowd. It\\'s not always a pleasant job, but sucking it up and being great at it anyway will give you an incredible advantage over others that won\\'t. And if you won\\'t, this is exactly how your competitors will eat your lunch and earn customers that could have been yours.\\n\\nWhere do I sell it?\\n\\nIt depends on the market you’re targeting and the game engine you’re building. Here are a few of the markets:\\n\\nThey all have their strengths and weaknesses. Naturally, I recommend the Unreal Engine Marketplace because I helped build it, but you may prefer asset stores with a larger content base or that specialize with different engines or types of art, such as architectural visualization. Shop around, see what appeals to you, check in with their communities to see how they are, and familiarize yourself. At this point, I recommend developing a content production pipeline that makes adapting your content for compliance and sale on as many different marketplaces as possible.\\n\\nTips and tricks for success\\n\\nIf you\\'re in the US, form a limited liability company (LLC). For more information on limited liability companies and the other types of companies you can form, check out this helpful page from LegalZoom. I\\'ve formed two LLCs through LegalZoom and I highly recommend them. Get an accountant. Be smart and organized about this from day one.\\n\\nThe most important thing you can do when supporting your customers is to acknowledge them quickly. Even if you don\\'t have an immediate or even satisfactory answer for their concern, this is important.\\n\\nThis is the best piece of advice you\\'ll get in this entire presentation: When doing work-for-hire content for your clients, identify which of your assignments could be sellable product. Negotiate a lower rate if they accept non-exclusivity so you can sell them on an online marketplace. You can open yourself up to a larger client base, make work-for-hire money, and generate a recurring revenue stream and a library as you do it.\\n\\nShip something every month. A regular release schedule and a library of content is important for marketing beats and re-promoting your earlier work. It\\'ll keep your motivation high.\\n\\nIndie devs: If you\\'re working on a game, consider selling some of the content you develop for it on an online marketplace. You can promote your game, attract talent and interest, and monetize early. Remember: Kickstarter is even more of a marketing vehicle than it is a fundraising tool.\\n\\nContractors: Selling content on a marketplace is an excellent marketing vehicle to drive interest toward your service-based offerings. What you get is publicity, reach, and an audience that will spend money for your product. If they want a more customized version of what you sell, or if they really like what you do and want to pay you to do it, let them. This could be your way out of a job you don\\'t like.\\n\\nGood luck out there!\\n', 'In just a few hours equity crowdfunding platform Fig will conclude its fourth successful campaign. Consortium: The Tower, a science fiction game being funded in part by BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk, will bring in\\xa0somewhere around $350,000. But only a portion of that money can be collected, because Fig is still working with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on key parts of its business model.\\n\\nNow, as the company treads water well beyond the period of time they originally expected to have to wait for SEC approval, Fig itself has brought on additional investment from famed developer Cliff Bleszinski.\\n\\nFig burst on to the scene earlier this year with a fairly transparent vision for an open equity crowdfunding model. Its first campaign, for a game called Outer Wilds, was only open to rewards-based backers and a small number of high net-worth, accredited investors. Its third campaign, for the much anticipated Psychonauts 2, was the first to live up to Fig\\'s ultimate promise. Everyone, regardless of income or net worth, was able to invest.\\n\\nAnd yet more than $1.8 million dollars remains uncollected from that campaign alone, not to mention the others that followed. Consortium is the third successful Fig campaign to be unable to collect on all of its money.\\n\\n\"The SEC filing must be qualified before we can collect the investment reservations placed by unaccredited investors,\" a Fig representative told Polygon via email in January of this year. \"We received comments back from the SEC on Jan. 17, which was 26 days after we made our filing, and the number of comments we received were low. As a result, we currently expect to be able to complete the unaccredited process in the next four-to-eight weeks.\"\\n\\nBut instead of a decision in March, there was another amended filing made by Fig, extending the review process. We\\'ve been able to locate it, dated March 10, on the publicly available Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website. You can read it here.\\n\\nAnother, standard four-to-eight week SEC review timeline therefore suggests that things could be looking up for Fig and its potential investors soon. The SEC may finally be ready to approve Fig\\'s equity investment package, and allow the teams already working on these games to finally receive the balance of their money. Or it could mean another few months for yet another amended solicitation and review.\\n\\nReached through his PR company yesterday for comment, Fig CEO and co-founder Justin Bailey would only say that \"we\\'re waiting to hear back from the SEC, and hope to provide an update as early as next week.\"\\n\\nMeantime, thousands who want to back Psychonauts 2 and Consortium are waiting to hear if they can put money in. They haven\\'t contributed anything yet; they\\'re just holding a receipt for the opportunity to invest. They have the option of tearing up that commitment at any time, and after months waiting for the other bureaucratic shoe to drop, it\\'s fair to question whether they\\'re still interested. Even if the SEC gives clearance to Fig, the developers of Psychonauts 2 and Consortium could come out with with less than they wanted to make their games.\\n', 'I was listening to Tom Hanks\\' Desert Island Discs on the bus this week when I realised I was in no way emotionally prepared for it. This should not have been surprising, of course, since Desert Island Discs, particularly with Kirsty in charge, has a formula that helps get beneath the skin of its guests like no other interview programme. Hanks is typically great from the off, inevitably, but if you want to find the moment that killed me, it\\'s around the 24 minute mark on the podcast, just after the theme from 2001 has played. Kirsty asks a gently probing question about Hanks\\' challenging childhood experiences, and after a slightly strangled \"Ahhhh,\" there\\'s a surprisingly long pause. Has the feed cut out? No. Because then Hanks asks, \"What have you done to me?\" and although he\\'s chuckling it\\'s clear that he\\'s also crying. Then, through the snotty nose of the weeper, comes the line that floored me. \"I\\'ve put far too much thought into this list.\"\\n\\nThis, right here, is not only what makes Desert Island Discs great. It\\'s what makes Tom Hanks great. The man is basically the biggest movie star in the world. He has four movies out this year, and all of them, I suspect, will contain something of magic. Also, as a 37 year old, I\\'m willing to admit that I spend most of my time under the illusion that either Harrison Ford or Hanks is my dad in some strange spectral way. He\\'s the dad of my generation, and yet, when asked to come on a BBC radio show, he takes it sufficiently seriously that he puts \"far too much thought\" into the list of records he is asked to choose, records that will travel with him to the desert island he has been sent to, a place much like the desert island he is sent to in Cast Away, which is Zemeckis and Hanks, and thus money in the bank as far as I am concerned.\\n\\nWhen I got off the bus, I felt even closer to Hanks than I did before, which is already alarmingly close, as you might have gathered. I was also struck by his choice of an item to take with him to the island: a Hermes 3000 typewriter. I\\'ve known for years that Hanks loves typewriters. In a New Yorker profile from the 1990s, I think he was trying to track down a Skywriter or somesuch, a specially designed machine that would fit snugly into the folding tray of a 1950s commuter flight seat. Then, a few years back, some fans sent him a 1934 Smith Corona when they asked him to come on their podcast, and he typed them a lovely note on it in reply. A note from Hanks! Or Hanx, rather, as he signs his Tweets, many of which - Hanx really is the best - revolve around items he has found on the street and wants to get back to their owners. You know the lone glove you always get propped on one of the railings outside of a cemetery? Hanx is there for that glove.\\n\\nThen I realised that he had released an app a while back. A typewriter app.Hanx Writer. How on earth had I never checked this out? So when I got to work, I downloaded it. Don\\'t disappoint me, Hanx!\\n\\nLike Hanx could disappoint. As if. Come on. Hanx Writer is developed by Hitcents.com, Inc, and it \"recreates the experience of a manual typewriter, but with the ease and speed of an iPad and iPhone.\" I am all for this. As a man with a fetish for mechanical keyboards, there is something truly soul-renewing about the clitter-clatter of fingers striking letters, of hammers impacting ribbons. Hanx greets you when you open his app with a little note about the typewriters he has owned, and how \"each one stamps into paper a permanent trail of imagination through keys, hammers, cloth and dye - a softer version of chiseling words into stone.\" He wants Hanx Writer to allow people to hear \"the rhythm of [their] work with SHOOK SHOOK or FITT-FITT.\" Hanx cares about the rhythm of text!\\n\\nSo it\\'s a writing tool, basically. You can type, save, export and print, and you can even buy different typewriters that affect things like the sound of your fingers on the keys. Even the starting machine, that comes free, is pretty special. I love the animation for changing a sheet of paper and I love the dull thunk of the shift key. I love the fact that Hanx Writer doesn\\'t auto-correct, since this would break the spell it is creating (no pun intended). You suddenly get to see how you really think the word \\'silhouette\\' is spelled, and the reality probably not pretty.\\n\\nWithin all this, there is something of Hanx - or Hanks - himself, of course. Something old fashioned and warm. Something that blends practicality with indulgence. The genius of Hanx Writer is that it takes something that\\'s already joyous, and it just makes it a bit more of an event. It makes you think of the wonderful analogue lineage of typing, the physicality and impact of setting down thoughts. If you\\'ve spent much time with manual typewriters, particularly the really old, heavy ones, you\\'ll know that striking the keys comes at a pleasant cost: after a week or so you\\'ll have little calluses at the ends of all your fingers. You will be hardened by the words you are casting at the page. These calluses were the true mark of the 20th century writer.\\n\\nI\\'m going to keep this app around, I think, and I may even buy one of the typewriter bundles. Hell, I might even buy an actual manual one day. A Hermes 3000, I think. Swiss and curvy and indestructible. Just like the one on that island so far away.\\n', 'Scottish indie pop group Chvrches released a new song today: \"Warning Call,\" written for the upcoming Mirrors Edge Catalyst. The band wrote the song specifically for the game, which hits PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One June 9,\\xa0a little later than planned.\\n\\nYou can listen to \"Warning Call\" above; fans will immediately recognize it as a Chvrches song, replete with plenty of synth, an anthemic chorus and other stylish pop effects. The band said in a press release that it identifies with Mirrors Edge Catalyst\\'s \"minimalist sci-fi dystopia\" setting, and that influence comes through in the track.\\n\\nChvrches have been associated with gaming in the past. The band appeared at\\xa0The Game Awards 2015 for\\xa0a live performance, playing \"Leave A Trace\" off their latest record. They released their sophomore album,\\xa0Every Open Eye, last September.\\n\\nFeel free to play the song on repeat while checking out our half-hour preview of Mirror\\'s Edge Catalyst\\'s closed beta below.\\n\\n\\n', \"After one mediocre season, ABC has decided to pull the plug on The Muppets,\\xa0according to The Hollywood Reporter.\\n\\nThe show was rushed to series after the pilot garnered quite a bit of attention at last year's upfront television conference, and even debuted to pretty high ratings despite lukewarm critical reviews.

In the latest update, Exploding Kittens continues to provide more reasons for people to laugh by adding a new avatar pack that's all about Science vs Religion. While other developers might have tried to go about this theme in a subtle way, Exploding Kittens goes head first by letting you play as Jesus or the Devil. So yes, not subtle but definitely funny, at least for me. The Avatar pack also adds Darwin, the Flying Spaghetti Monster (because why not), Tesla, Edison, Marie Curie, and Jibbers. And, of course, they all come with hilarious sound effects. The pack costs $1.99, which is a small price to pay to play as Jesus or the Devil.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunnily enough, the update also aims to make playing the game less offensive by allowing players to flag and hide offensive usernames, which (unfortunately) has been increasingly an issue. The update also lets you turn off the sounds, although why would anyone want to do that is beyond me, and includes the usual bug fixes and performance improvements. And now the question is which of these fictional characters will be the most popular.\\n\\n\\n\", '\\n', 'The recent trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gave us the first look at the upcoming Star Wars spinoff, but there is still plenty of mystery about the film. A few more details have been revealed in a preview for the upcoming book Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: The Official Visual Story Guide, including character names and some of ships that will appear. Check them out in the gallery below:\\n\\nAs reported by JediBibliothek, 10 pages of the book have been featured in a winter guide for publisher MacMillan.

There\\'s the Imperial TIE Striker and a sleek Rebel Starfighter, plus old favourites such as the AT-AT Walkers glimpsed in the trailer. Darth Vadar also appears on one page, suggesting that we may see the infamous Sith Lord in the movie.\\n\\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story is directed by Gareth Edwards, and comes to cinemas on December 16, 2016.\\n', 'Spoiler alert: While plot details are not given, anyone who wants a total blackout before seeing Rogue One in December should stop here.\\n\\nSample pages from an upcoming story guide for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story have slipped out to the Internet, and they reveal names of the principal characters, describes their roles within the film\\'s story, and adds details on spacecraft and other features in the movie.\\n\\nThe 10 pages,\\xa0available here, reveal the following character, some of whom are known, and others who were seen but not named in the trailer that was released in April.

It's a shame, then, that it loses momentum so quickly.\\n\\nLet's get that first impression out of the way first, though. The Deer God is an absolutely beautiful game. In it, you play a hunter whose soul has been trapped in a deer after his accidental death in order to atone for his crimes against nature. In your new form you'll travel through dense forests, arid deserts, frozen tundra, lush jungles and many more breathtaking environments.\\n\\nVisually, the game has a modern retro feel to it. It employs 3D pixel-style art and makes smart uses or parallax scrolling to give the illusion of depth to its varied environments. All of the environments feature beautiful lighting effects that really make them come to life. The Deer God is truly one of the few games that as is attractive in motion as its marketing materials may try to make you believe.\\n\\nAdmiring the sights in The Deer God is indeed a pleasure, but there is a game lurking underneath those gorgeous visuals and it isn't nearly the work of art you might expect. Mechanically, The Deer God is very similar to 2D side-scrolling games of old. You can run left or right, jump and attack, but that's about it. As you travel, you'll grow from a fawn into a strong buck. The world is similar to that of a roguelike in the sense that the environments are randomly generated.\\n\\nThe idea of randomly generated maps is good in theory, in that it provides the player with something unique and interesting in each play session - however, in the case of this game it's the biggest failing. The goals in The Deer God aren't immediately clear; you'll meet with an elder early on who will give you the ability to double jump, and this sets the pace for the rest of the game. Occasionally you will run into someone in need of help, or find a simple puzzle in need of solving. The game progresses through completing these quests, but the environments often get in the way more than they should.\\n\\nThe majority of quests in The Deer God involve finding an item and returning it to the person that requested it. Sometimes this means the item is mere steps away from the person, but at others you can be running for 15 or 20 minutes before finding it, coupled with another five or ten to find the NPC again. Running through the colourful environs of The Deer God is fun, but the environments are built out of only a handful of pre-defined elements, meaning you'll see frequent repetition of puzzles, cave structures and platforming challenges. Moreover, the longer you play, the more pronounced the load times become as the game struggles to build more elements for you to explore. In our experience we noticed considerably longer load times the more we ran.\\n\\nThe disappointing decisions don't just stop at the world building, either. This game is incredibly easy, even in hardcore mode. In hardcore mode the idea is that once you are out of lives the game is over, permanently; your save is deleted and you must start over from scratch. However, the world is littered with opportunities to resurrect yourself. Extra lives are available in the form of deer skulls, but you can also mate with deer which will let you reincarnate should you die. Each time you die you will be reincarnated by the Deer God as a different animal, depending on your karma. If you have good karma, which you get by killing hostile creatures and humans, you'll be reincarnated as a fawn. Amass too much bad karma, and you'll be reincarnated as a helpless bunny until enough times passes, at which point you'll change back into a fawn and be allowed to mature again.\\n\\nEnemies in general didn't seem all that threatening in our experience, and combat was unsatisfying. Combat is essentially just charging at enemies, though none of the enemies pose much of a challenge, bosses included. Aside from the karma aspect, The Deer God offers no real motivation for killing enemies, as fleeing is often easier.\\n\\nWe also would have liked to see The Deer God make better use of the Wii U's GamePad. In it, action is mirrored to the display, but we wish we could manage inventory from there. Hitting the Y button during gameplay pauses the game and displays an inventory screen which allows you to assign items to one of two inputs; everything is laid out in a practically GamePad-ready grid, and it would certainly feel less cumbersome to drag and drop items than highlight them with the d-pad and select them.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Deer God is beautiful. Sadly, that beauty is only skin deep. Poor design choices take away from fantastic visuals that really have to be seen. With the right level of polish, this could have been one of our favourite indie games on Wii U.\\n\\nInstead, clumsy quest design, repetitive environments and poor performance ensure The Deer God will be remembered as little more than eye candy.\\n\", \"\\n\\nSony and developer Polyphony Digital have announced a release date for the competition-focused GT Sport, as well as the game's pre-order bonuses and special edition.\\n\\nThe PS4 game comes out on November 15, and its multiplayer focus encompasses two championship series: one where you race for your country, and the other your manufacturer.\\n\\nYou can now pre-order the title, and depending on where you go, you'll get different goodies (click the PS Blog link below for more information).

Part one dealt with the inspiration behind many of the game\\'s mechanics, along with a discussion of the highly divisive control scheme. Now, Nintendo has gone ahead and translated the second part of the interview, delving deeper into the gameplay.\\n\\nThe first part starts off by reviewing the vehicles and all of the different forms they can take, highlighting how the different forms of each vehicle broaden the scope and variety of the gameplay far beyond that of previous games. Also – as it would happen – the Retro Walker that you obtain by scanning the Fox amiibo is actually the original model that was set to feature in the never-released Star Fox 2.\\n\\nMoving on from there, they discuss the Zoness stage that featured the Gyrowing, stating that it was included to break up gameplay a bit and to have an \"Adventure\" stage present. Next, they discuss Miyamoto\\'s involvement in the game, which was essentially that of director. Miyamoto goes on to say that he hasn\\'t actually been credited as a director on a game since Super Mario 64, and that the next closest game where he had as much influence was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\\n\\nThe whole thing can be found here; it makes for quite a fascinating read.\\n\\nWhat do you think?

We\\'ve reached out to Valve for additional comment and will update this story when they respond.\\n\\nThe suit was filed on April 12, 2016, and Valve has denied all wrongdoing in its response. \\n\\nAccording to the April 12 filing, the plaintiff worked at Valve\\'s headquarters  in Washington state prior to 2012. Sometime in 2012, the litigant planned to undergo gender transition and told the company she needed to move to Los Angeles, where her doctors were located and where she could recover while still working.\\n\\nValve accommodated her request, allowing her to work from home in LA to recover from the surgery, but also because of \"related disabilities including depression.\" The company required the translator to be reclassified as an independent contractor as a condition of the move, according to the suit.\\n\\nThe translator continued to work at Valve until earlier this year, when she filed a complaint about unpaid translators whom she felt were being exploited and lured to work for free based on \"false promises made by her supervisor,\" according to the suit.\\n\\nWithin days of filing a written complaint about the practice, the translator was fired, the lawsuit says. Valve said at the time that her job was being relocated to Washington. But when the translator offered to move, Valve declined to keep her on, according to the suit.\\n\\nThe translator believes she was fired because of her complaint and because her supervisor was uncomfortable with her being a transgender woman. According to the suit, he would refer to the translator as \"it.\"\\n\\nThe suit is seeking $1 million for general damages, $1 million for special damages, $150,000 for unpaid wages and penalties, and $1 million for loss of earnings. The translator is also asking for punitive damages to be decided by the court.\\n\\nIn its written response, filed May 20, Valve denied every allegation made and asked for the complaint to be dismissed.\\n', '\\nTitanfall 2 has added a grappling hook, according to a new leak.\\n\\nArtwork and gameplay details for Respawn\\'s sci-fi shooter sequel were posted anonymously on Reddit last night.\\n\\nGrappling hooks will apparently have multiple uses, such as \"getting into your Titan, aiding free-running, or tactical plays such as pulling enemies while they\\'re midair\".\\n\\nCan mechs now wall run too?\\n\\nThe poster also provided artwork which matches and expands on an image partially visible on the official Titanfall site.\\n\\nThe setting looks larger than the areas found in Titanfall 1, and the poster has said that the sequel\\'s maps will now be bigger.

But now his career lies in ruins after he was convicted of one count of sexual activity with a child and admitted another.\\n\\nA year ago, Johnson, who was cleared of a further count of sexual activity with a child, appeared to have it all. He was playing for Sunderland - the club he had supported as a boy - and his partner, Stacey Flounders, had given birth to their first child in January.\\n\\nThat same month though, he met up with an adoring schoolgirl fan and embarked on a path of behaviour which led to his arrest in March 2015.\\n\\n\"He had the world at his feet only to contemptuously spurn the gifts afforded him in such a cavalier and luridly sordid manner,\" Nick Barnes, BBC Newcastle\\'s Sunderland commentator, said. \\n\\nDespite initially being suspended by Sunderland, he was soon reinstated and his performances helped the Black Cats avoid relegation to the Championship. \\n\\nHis partner also pledged to stand by him. She posted loving pictures of Johnson and their daughter on social media and was pictured holding his hand when he arrived for his magistrates\\' court appearances.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut a year later, his world came crashing down. As his trial at Bradford Crown Court was due to start, he admitted one count of grooming and one of sexual activity with a child, but denied two further charges. \\n\\nAlmost immediately he was sacked by Sunderland, and his contract with sportswear firm Adidas was cancelled.\\n\\nHis relationship with Ms Flounders also broke down. Johnson\\'s \"arrogance and stupidity\" was laid bare before a jury and he admitted he had been unfaithful to her.\\n\\nFollowing his arrest, Johnson said in court he told Sunderland bosses he had messaged the girl and kissed her, but he continued to earn £60,000 a week playing for the club until his last-minute guilty plea - an admission which saw him accused of waiting until the court case began so he could maximise his career and earnings. \\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nPhil McNulty, BBC Sport\\'s chief football writer \\n\\nAdam Johnson was a highly gifted but inconsistent player who failed to fulfil the potential that saw him win a Premier League title medal with Manchester City in 2011-12 and persuaded Sunderland to pay £10m to sign him later that year. \\n\\nBlessed with pace and unpredictability, as well as the knack for a spectacular goal, he also should have done more on the international stage with England, for whom he won 12 caps but - as with his clubs - Johnson could never produce his natural gifts on a regular basis.\\n\\nIt would seem he is now lost to the game at the highest level forever without ever becoming the high-quality player many thought he had the capability to become.\\n\\nHowever, if Johnson was open with his club as he claimed to be in court, it raises the question of whether someone who had admitted such an offence should have been allowed on the pitch, or if Sunderland had taken the decision not to drop one of its star players for commercial reasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                  Adam Johnson\\'s career timeline                \\n\\n\\n1995 Begins youth career with Newcastle United \\n\\n\\n1995 Begins youth career with Newcastle United \\n\\n\\n2004 Part of the Middlesbrough FA Youth Cup-winning side \\n\\n\\n2004 Part of the Middlesbrough FA Youth Cup-winning side \\n\\n\\n2005 Makes his senior debut, aged 17, in a UEFA Cup match \\n\\n\\n2005 Makes his senior debut, aged 17, in a UEFA Cup match \\n\\n\\n2010 Joins Manchester City in a £7m deal; First England appearance \\n\\n\\n2010 Joins Manchester City in a £7m deal; First England appearance \\n\\n\\n2011 Part of Manchester City\\'s FA Cup-winning side \\n\\n\\n2011 Part of Manchester City\\'s FA Cup-winning side \\n\\n\\n2012 Manchester City win the Premier League; Adam Johnson joins Sunderland for a £10m transfer fee \\n\\n\\n2012 Manchester City win the Premier League; Adam Johnson joins Sunderland for a £10m transfer fee \\n\\nSource: BBC Sport\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nNick Barnes said Johnson was \"too valuable a playing asset\" and could have played a \"significant role in helping the club steer themselves away from relegation\" this season.\\n\\n\"My personal view is that he should have been suspended on full pay, as I believe the club owed Johnson and the rest of the playing and backroom staff a duty of care; firstly in not exposing Johnson to taunts and chants from opposing fans labelling him a paedophile, and secondly in not placing his colleagues and staff in a position of having to be embarrassed by his situation, which in retrospect they could argue was unacceptable bearing in mind his guilty plea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The club also left itself open to accusations of being blind to the seriousness of the charges brought against him.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t accept the argument that suspending him is an indication of guilt. By definition electing to go to trial means there is a doubt over the outcome so therefore the club should have taken the stance \\'if in doubt leave him out\\'.\"\\n\\nSunderland AFC said it had been informed Johnson was intending to deny all charges and was not informed at any point that he was going to change his plea.\\n\\nIt said in a statement: \"Had the club known that Mr. Johnson intended to plead guilty to any of these charges, then his employment would have been terminated immediately.  \\n\\n\"Indeed, upon learning of the guilty plea on 11 February 2016, the club acted quickly and decisively in terminating Adam Johnson\\'s contract without notice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                  Adam Johnson\\'s football career                \\n\\n£10m\\n\\nSunderland AFC transfer fee\\n\\nSource: BBC Sport\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nLike many professional footballers, Johnson was born into a working class background.

All three were suggested in court and when he took to the witness box he owned up to each one. \\n\\nYet Johnson\\'s demeanour was not of the swaggering, millionaire footballer. \\n\\nHis voice was soft and low and at one point he appeared close to tears as he spoke of letting down his partner, Stacey Flounders. \\n\\nHe said he was \"embarrassed\", and he had not been a good partner to her and their newborn baby.\\n\\nWhen it was her turn to give evidence and she was asked if she saw any future for their relationship, he sat head bowed as she replied: \"Not at the minute, no.\" \\n\\nIn court it emerged Johnson sent texts to his partner while he was with the victim, and on another occasion responded to Ms Flounders\\' messages about their baby, while sending lewd texts to the girl, detailing their last encounter as \"class\".\\n\\nMr Barnes added: \"Johnson\\'s actions were at the extreme end and one should in no way judge footballers by his standards, but the lifestyle he led and the rarefied company he kept undoubtedly shaped the man he became.\\n\\n\"A man who scored a desperately tragic own goal.\"\\n\\n\\n', \"Sheil KapadiaESPN Writer CloseCovered the Philadelphia Eagles for Philadelphia Magazine and Philly.com from 2008 to 2015.\\nCovered the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL for BaltimoreSun.com from 2006 to 2008.\\n\\nSheil KapadiaESPN Writer \\n\\nCovered the Philadelphia Eagles for Philadelphia Magazine and Philly.com from 2008 to 2015.\\n\\nCovered the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL for BaltimoreSun.com from 2006 to 2008.\\n\\nSeattle Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor was trying to get information on a Washington gym Wednesday evening when two women called the police on him because they thought he was trying to rob the place.\\n\\nChancellor shared the story on Twitter.\\n\\nThe funniest thing just happened too me in Redmond.

That was his last full-time starting gig in the NFL, though he's appeared in at least three games in each of the last five seasons.\\xa0\\n\\nLast season, during his time as a starter in Dallas after Tony Romo was injured, Cassel was one of Pro Football Focus' lowest-rated quarterbacks (h/t Rotoworld's Evan Silva):\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong 38 qualifiers, @PFF's bottom-5 graded QBs over the last 6 weeks:34.

This isn\\'t fair to Spieth or any of the younger players, but Woods\\' impact on the game was so significant that many fans still long for his glory days.\\n\\nOne area where Woods will likely forever reign superior is his knack for making cuts.

When Spieth won this event last year, he was the only player to post under-par scores in all four rounds.\\n\\nBrian Davis carded a second-round 76 at the 2015 Valspar Championship and managed to still finish in the top 10, so Spieth can certainly salvage a strong result if he bounces back on short order.\\n\\nNo matter what happens in this tournament, though, Spieth has to be a bit discouraged with the Masters not far away.

For a team like India, whose T20 star has been on the rise, almost every single player has contributed.\\n\\nHowever, players who are consistent in this format are usually the ones who become invaluable to their side and Rohit Sharma has done just that.\\n\\nIn the last two years only Virat Kohli and Mohammad Shahzad have scored more runs in T20s than Sharma. When the criteria is narrowed to the last year, Sharma is still third on the list for most runs in the T20 format. He is also the most consistent with three fifties and a century in 13 matches.\\n\\nSharma’s biggest strength lies in his ability to accelerate his innings, something which has been especially prevalent when he is batting in one-day cricket.\\n\\nWhen Sharma scored that incredible 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014, he took his time. You might not think that when you saw that he had reached the total in 173 balls, but he did. Here's how he broke things down:\\n\\nThe first 50 came off 72 balls, his 100 off 100 balls, the 150 off 125 balls, he reached 200 off 151 balls and moved onto 250 off 166 balls before, finally, his total was 264 off 173 balls.\\n\\nAs an opener, this ability to accelerate an innings is incredibly important, especially in the T20 format. While India certainly aren’t lacking in big-hitters who can come in and obliterate a team lower down the order, that Sharma can set a foundation and help the team build from there is vital.\\n\\nIf that same player can stay at the crease and launch the innings himself once he’s played himself in, his value rises.\\n\\nWhen Sharma scored his maiden T20 century against South Africa last year, he did exactly that. His first 24 runs came off 22 balls and he moved to 50 off 39 balls. In T20 cricket, that's a fairly average strike rate.\\n\\nHowever, he brought up the next 50 runs that took him to his hundred off just 23 balls. Sure, South Africa’s dubious bowling helped in this instance, but a player still has to stick it out and pick the bad balls.\\n\\nA few years ago Sharma had earned the moniker “No Hit Sharma” in certain Twitter circles. Considering his returns in cricket were modest until 2013, the moniker wasn’t entirely unfair. \\xa0\\n\\nWhile he still has much to prove in the Test format, in T20s, Sharma has shown that having the heart and patience of a Test cricketer with the brain and aggression of a T20 cricketer can go a very long way.\\n\\nSharma is definitely most effective when India bat first (averaging 35.75 vs 28.76 when batting second) he has scored five fifties both batting first and batting second.\\n\\nThat average rises to 56.66 in matches where India have batted first and won, which might be an indication that No Hit has become a hit and an instrumental part in setting India up for impressive victories in the T20 format.\\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith plenty of parts already in place on offense, the New York Jets were an easy choice for Matt Forte in free agency.\\n\\nThe former Bears running back told reporters Monday that he \"envisioned\" himself playing in New York\\'s Chan Gailey-led attack, a move that reunites Forte with former Chicago wideout Brandon Marshall.\\n\\nThe duo went at each other last offseason, when the veteran back criticized\\xa0Marshall, telling reporters that \"sometimes Brandon couldn\\'t hold himself accountable,\" per the New York Daily News.\\n\\nForte sang a different tune on Monday, citing Marshall\\'s on-field talents and off-the-field pitch session as factors in joining the Jets.\\n\\n\"He gave me the whole rundown of the team and why I would be a good fit,\" Forte said of Marshall. \"At that time, I really didn\\'t think the Jets would be the frontrunner, but as it got closer and closer, I started thinking how it would be a good fit.\"\\n\\nSaid Forte: \"No tension. Me and Brandon, we hold each other accountable. Even when we\\'re not on the same team we do the same thing, because we\\'re friends off the field, not just in the locker room. It may sound harsh when you\\'re talking to each other over the media and things might get twisted, but we spoke to each other over the phone after that and hashed everything out.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what else we learned from Forte:\\n\\n1. Both Marshall and Forte are wondering what will happen under center, with New York entrenched in a stare down with free-agent quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. \"Based off of last year\\'s production, you know, Brandon has talked about the chemistry he\\'s built with Ryan, so I would expect and hopefully it would be him just to build off what they built last year.\"\\n\\n2. Forte acknowledged that it gave him pause to sign with a club missing their starting passer, saying: \"Yeah, there is (hesitation), but I also thought that much about the organization.\"\\n\\n3. Even with Bilal Powell and Khiry Robinson on the roster, Forte is expecting a major role in New York\\'s backfield. Coming off a campaign that saw him log his fewest carries since 2011, the 30-year-old runner said he feels \"really healthy\" this offseason, adding: \"They see me as an every-down back, that\\'s what we talked about. We left it at that.\"\\n', 'The Cleveland Browns are taking their lumps right now.\\n\\nThe team\\'s quiet approach to free agency hasn\\'t helped, with four key players walking out the door -- an exodus that only turned up the heat on a newfangled front office led by executive VP of football operations Sashi Brown and former MLB executive Paul DePodesta.\\n\\nThe DePodesta hire caused plenty of heads to turn as general managers and scouts around the league asked what the Browns were doing hiring a baseball guy. Speaking Friday at MIT\\'s Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, DePodesta said he overheard NFL team officials ripping him and the Browns at the airport after last month\\'s Scouting Combine.\\n\\n\"I was standing right in front of them in line and I could hear them in back of me and they were talking trash about me and the Cleveland Browns,\" DePodesta said Friday at MIT\\'s Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, per Baseball America. \"I said, \\'All right, this is like 17 years ago in Oakland all over again.\\' That\\'s part of the fun.\"\\n\\nDePodesta\\'s handiwork with the Oakland Athletics, Dodgers and most recently the Mets makes him a well-known face in baseball circles. Not so much in the NFL.\\n\\nThe pressure will only expand from here, with the Browns staring down another potentially dismal season on the field. The addition of coach Hue Jackson helps, but the key for DePodesta in Cleveland is a willingness to see this rebuilding project through. It\\'s likely to get worse before it gets better, but that\\'s something DePodesta is prepared for:\\n\\n\"When I was going to the Browns,\" DePodesta said, \"I had met with the ownership, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and they asked me, \\'What do you want out of an owner?\\' And I said, \\'Well, I\\'ll tell you what I don\\'t want.\\' I said, \\'If you ever take your kids to an amusement park at Disneyland or whatever, they beg you to go on the big daddy roller coaster. They beg you. You say, \\'Are you sure?\\' They say, \\'Absolutely, I want to go on this thing.\\' So you wait in line for 45 minutes, it takes up a good chunk of your day, you finally get to the front of the line, they eyeball it, and they say, \\'Uh, I\\'m not getting on that thing. Not at all.\\'\\n\\nSaid DePodesta: \"And that\\'s what happens to a lot of owners. They would say, \\'Hey, we want \\'Moneyball,\\' we want this disciplined approach to what we\\'re doing.\\' But then when it comes time to making that hard decision, they say, \\'I donâ\\x80\\x99t want any part of this.\\' I said, \\'I need someone who\\'s going to want to get on the roller coaster with me knowing that it\\'s not always going to be fun. There are going to be parts of the roller coaster that are going to be scary, that are going to be uncomfortable, but hopefully at the end of the ride when we get off, you\\'re going to want to say, let\\'s do that again.\\' But I think that\\'s how we always got through it, was having that shared vision from the beginning and giving you the conviction to actually go through with it.\"\\n', '\\nVIDEO\\n\\n\\nPinball was illegal in New York City from 1940 till 1976. The above short explores the surprisingly troubled history of pinball in New York and why it was banned there for over 35 years. The ban was lifted when  WWII ended and the state finally (and rightfully) determined that pinball is a game of skill and not a game of chance. The great Big Story explains:\\n\\nIn 1940, pinball machines were banned in New York City. Like most contraband, this simply pushed pinball underground. After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, the “Salvage for Victory” campaign called on Americans to turn in scrap metal to bolster the war effort. As a result, then New York City mayor Fiorello LaGuardia went on a hunt for pinball machines. By February 1942, more than 3,000 machines has been confiscated, turning roughly 2,500 of them into one ton of metal for the war. Unfortunately for pinball enthusiasts, the ban in New York lasted for decades, outliving LaGuardia, who died in 1947.\\n', \"Editor's note: This infographic was published before the 2016 NCAA tournament tipped off. And the opening Thursday brought two more 12-seed wins over a 5-seed with Yale knocking off Baylor and Arkansas-Little Rock taking down Purdue.\\n\\nThis season has been full of upsets, so bracket builders and pundits alike are expecting plenty in this tournament. But one first-round matchup is infamously perilous for the earlier seed every year: the dreaded 5-seed vs. 12-seed matchup.

No 4-seed has a lower-than-84 percent chance of winning its first-round matchup.) So before you submit your brackets, make sure you know what to expect from one of the tournament's most common upsets.\\n\\nOver the past 31 tournaments, 12-seeds have won 36 percent of games -- far better than a 13-seed's 20 percent and actually a percentage point better even than 11-seeds' records. In fact, 12-seeds have a better record (by one win!) than 11-seeds in the first round.\\n\\nDon't expect 12-seed winners to be one-and-dones, either: 12-seeds actually have more wins in the second round than 11-seeds, too -- at 20-24, they're not too far off a .500 record. (No surprise, their better record is against 13-seeds.) In the Sweet 16, 12-seeds are just 1-19: one win coming against an 8-seed and 19 losses to No. 1s. Only one 12-seed has made the Elite Eight, when Missouri lost to Oklahoma in overtime in 2002.\\n\\nThere have been 26 wins by the 12th seed since 2000; there were just 18 from 1985 to 1999. Last season was one of just four since 1985 without a 12-seed upset. (Before last year, there hadn't been one since 2007.) There have been four seasons in which a No. 12 has pulled off three upsets in the first round, including two of the past three tourneys.\\n\\nStats compiled by ESPN The Magazine research department.\\n\", 'DALLAS -- Dirk Nowitzki knows a little bit about revolutionizing the NBA.

His range is basically as soon as he crosses half court. He\\'s making shots look routine that no other player can even make in practice consistently. He just makes it look effortless. He just kind of goes up from the dribble in one motion, doesn\\'t waste any effort there. Incredible.\\n\\nHe\\'s so much fun to watch. When he\\'s in the zone, I catch myself screaming at the TV, \\'Shoot! Shoot!\\' as soon as he crosses half court. It\\'s so much fun to watch.\\n\\nYou know, we\\'ve had some great athletes and specimens in this league, but that\\'s not him. He\\'s a smaller guy. Obviously, he\\'s quick, but the way he makes it is with skill. That\\'s why everybody is rooting for him, because everybody can relate to him.\\n\\nMacMahon: Are you more impressed with his ability to shoot and his range or his ability to create shots when everybody is trying to stop him from getting those shots up?\\n\\nNowitzki: The thing is, he shoots it so quick off the dribble that you never really know when he\\'s going to pull up. He\\'s kind of like here [Nowitzki pretends to dribble a ball], and then next thing you know he comes up with the ball out of his dribble and the ball is gone within a split second. Obviously, he\\'s still pretty quick off the dribble, so the guy has got to be worried about him just driving by. But he\\'s in such a great groove right now that it\\'s almost better to let him drive by and lay it in. At least that\\'s only two points, you know?\\n\\nMacMahon: You changed the way people think about the power forward position. Before you, power forwards didn\\'t shoot 3s. Now, if they can\\'t, it\\'s considered a flaw. Do you see him changing the way the point guard position is played?\\n\\nNowitzki: Yeah, I just don\\'t know if we\\'ll see that again. Obviously, a lot of kids now are going to try to imitate that and shoot 3s from deep. Maybe in a few years, that\\'s normal. I don\\'t know. If kids start shooting at an early age, start hoisting runners from 40 feet, maybe 10 years down the road you do have to move the 3-point line back. But as of now, he\\'s really the only guy that can make those over and over and over. If you watch his pregame, he does that all the time. He\\'s a freak.\\n\\nMacMahon: How much has he changed the dimensions of the way you have to play defense?\\n\\n\"When he\\'s in the zone, I catch myself screaming at the TV, \\'Shoot! Shoot!\\' as soon as he crosses half court.\"\\n\\nNowitzki: They\\'re just so smart with it. Draymond Green running up there and setting those step-ups at half court, and [Curry] comes full court at the big guy full speed. It\\'s just tough to guard when he can stop on a dime and pull up from wherever. They\\'re a smart team, a veteran team. That\\'s why they\\'re the champs. They\\'re tough to match up [against]. They\\'re also really good on their defense with their small lineup. Klay [Thompson] has been great. They\\'re a really good team.\\n\\nMacMahon: You say we\\'ve never seen anything like Steph before, but do you see shades of Steve Nash in his game?\\n\\nNowitzki: For sure, for sure. Some of the flashy, behind-the-back passes and how he pushes it on the break and pulls up. When they do get in the lane, they kind of get caught in the air and make stuff up, up in the air. That\\'s special. He\\'s obviously a lot better shooter off the dribble and scorer than Steve ever was, but I see some of the movements, some of the drives, some of the behind-the-backs in traffic and stuff like that that Steve definitely had.\\n\\nBut I think Steve never looked to shoot as much. He was always a setup guy first. Even sometimes, we had to force him to shoot, because he was such a great shooter. With Steph, if he has any daylight -- or really, no daylight -- that thing\\'s going up.

The Spurs' league-leading defense held the defending champs to a season-low 79 points on 37.8 percent shooting and the reigning Kia MVP, Stephen Curry, to just 14 points on a season-low 1-for-12 from 3-point land. It was a dominating performance that silenced any doubters who believed San Antonio was overmatched by Golden State after their 30-point loss in mid-January. The Spurs face another challenge tonight against the Charlotte Hornets, who are one of the hottest teams in the league since February. Speaking of the Hornets' hot stretch ... \\n\\n \\n\\nAll The Buzz\\n\\n The Spurs (20-2) and the Warriors (19-3) are the only teams to have a better record than the Hornets (17-5) since January 31. Charlotte has the third best defensive rating and the ninth best offensive rating during this span. Since the beginning of March, the Hornets have the third best offensive rating. They're led by Kemba Walker, who has been unbelievable over this stretch with averages of 25.2 points on 47.6 percent shooting, 6.4 assists and 5.5 rebounds in 36.6 minutes since March 1. The best way for the Spurs to defend the Hornets' attack is to control the 3-point line. Charlotte ranks third in 3-pointers made, fifth in 3-pointers attempted and sixth in 3-point percentage since January 31. \\n\\n \\n\\nPlayoff Implications\\n\\n The Spurs enter with a comfortable, 11.5-game lead over the Thunder for the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference and trail the Warriors by just 3.0 games for the No. 1 seed. They still have two more matchups against Golden State over the final 13 games of the season, so there's still a chance for them to claim the top spot and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. Charlotte finds itself in a much tighter race as it sits in the No. 6 seed out East. The Hornets trail the Hawks by 1.5 games for the No. 3 seed and lead the No. 9 seed Pistons by just 3.5 games. A win tonight would go a long way for Charlotte as it looks to land in one of the top four seeds to secure home court advantage in the first round. \\n\\n Grizzlies vs. Suns (10 ET, NBA TV) \\n\\nGrizzlies vs. Suns (10 ET, NBA TV)\\n\\n \\n\\nGrit And Mend\\n\\n The Grizzlies have been ravished by injuries over the past few weeks, playing for significant stretches without Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Zach Randolph. Memphis started strong without Gasol, going 9-4 over their first 13 games without the All-NBA center. But the losses of Conley and Randolph proved too much to handle as they suffered a four-game losing streak last week. Fortunately for Memphis, Randolph returned on Saturday against the Clippers and tallied the first triple-double of his career to lead Memphis to victory. The Grizzlies are currently the No. 5 seed in the West and lead the No. 9 seed Jazz by 6.0 games. But this buffer could dissolve quickly as the Grizzlies matchup with the Warriors twice, Spurs twice, Raptors, Mavericks and Clippers over their final 12 games. This tough remaining schedule increases the importance of a win against the struggling Suns tonight. \\n\\nRandolph's 1st Triple-Double\\n\\nZach Randolph recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists against the Clippers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSetting Suns\\n\\n Phoenix is officially eliminated from playoff contention after a brutal season full of injuries and distractions. Despite their rough play, the Suns have been better of late with a record of 4-4 over their last eight games (including a 109-100 victory over the Grizzlies two weeks ago). Nineteen-year-old rookie Devin Booker has been one of the few bright spots for Phoenix this season as he averages 21.7 points, 5.3 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 38.0 minutes during the month of March. Booker, alongside point guard Brandon Knight, will look to outpace the battered Grizzlies and continue their solid stretch to close out the season. \\n\\n \\n\\nLance Makes 'Em Dance\\n\\n Lance Stephenson has been a necessary boost of offense for the Grizzlies since he was acquired from the Los Angeles Clippers in mid-February. In 15 games with the Grizzlies, Stephenson is averaging 15.0 points on 49.2 percent shooting, 5.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and only 1.6 turnovers in 26.8 minutes. He has two games with more than 20 points during this span, including a 33-point explosion against the Pelicans on March 11. Keep an eye on Stephenson tonight as look to spark the Grizzlies to a key road win in Phoenix. \\n\\n -- \\n\\n NBA.com staff reports  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Australia sealed their first win of the 2016 World Twenty20 with a three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Bangalore.\\n\\nSpinner Adam Zampa took 3-23 but Bangladesh scored 44 in the last three overs to make 156-5 after being put in.\\n\\nAll-rounder Mahmudullah struck seven fours and a six in an unbeaten 49 from 29 balls and Shakib Al Hasan made 33.\\n\\nIn reply Usman Khawaja fired a maiden T20 fifty but Australia lost 5-37 inside five overs before edging home with nine deliveries remaining.\\n\\nThe Australians, winners of five 50-over World Cups, have yet to win the T20 version, with defeat by England in the 2010 final the nearest they have come to date.\\n\\nAfter losing to New Zealand in their first group match they overcame a few decidedly anxious moments against the Tigers to revive their Group 2 campaign and are next in action against Pakistan - who have also played one and lost one thus far - in Mohali on Friday.\\n\\nWho is Adam Zampa?\\n\\nThe blonde 23-year-old leg-spinner born in New South Wales made his debut for Australia in a one-day international against New Zealand last month and took three wickets in two matches.\\n\\nAfter failing to get in the wickets column in his first three T20 internationals, he struck with his second delivery against Bangladesh, took another in his next over with a quicker flipper that claimed an lbw and an important third when left-hander Shakib top edged to backward point.  \\n\\nChipping in to cover Tamim\\n\\nBangladesh were dealt a major blow shortly before the start of the match when Tamim Iqbal, their cavalier left-handed opener and leading run-scorer in all three formats, was ruled out because of illness.\\n\\nTamim had struck five sixes in his maiden T20 international century against Oman in the first stage but in his absence, four separate batsmen hit sixes against the Australians, each of them reaching double figures at a strike rate in excess of 100.\\n\\nThe majority were all too brief cameos but Mahmudullah shared 51 from 29 balls with Mushfiqur as Bangladesh recorded their highest total in four T20 meetings with Australia.\\n\\nAustralia come close to capitulation\\n\\nRuthless with anything short, stylish left-hander Khawaja appeared to have done the bulk of the work for the Australians when he missed a leg glance and was bowled with 42 required from as many balls.\\n\\nGlenn Maxwell then looked to have settled any doubts when he smashed three fours in the 16th over bowled by debutant left-arm spinner Saqlain Sajib, but after two mighty sixes in the following over that also saw Mitchell Marsh depart, the big-hitting all-rounder was stumped with nine still needed.\\n\\nHaving been dropped and seen a run out chance fumbled, John Hastings hit straight to deep mid-wicket before, to the great relief of the Australian bench, James Faulkner received a long hop from Sajib and pulled it for a winning boundary.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nDerick E.

It\\'s something that needs to be done and needs time to heal.\"\\n\\nWhile the 26-43 Pelicans are out of the postseason hunt, making the decision to end Davis\\' season an easy one, the news comes as a bigger blow to Team USA, as Davis was expected to be a major contributor on that squad.\\n\\nTeam USA should be loaded with NBA stars, but Davis is one of the brightest young players in the league. Davis averaged 24.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game this season and has become one of the most compelling and well-rounded players in the game. Few players combine his impact in the paint on both ends with elite athleticism and the ability to stretch defenses out to the three-point line.\\n\\nFor the Pelicans, having Davis at 100 percent for the start of next season is vital.

It\\'s part of his coping mechanism, but it\\'s also Lin\\'s way of shrugging off distractions and keeping things moving. Times are too good right now for his surging Hornets to allow anyone\\'s silly identification issues to disrupt their momentum.\\n\\nAt this rate, Lin and the Hornets only care to be recognized as a legitimate contender in the East, one as capable as anyone of finishing the season strong and rolling through the conference playoff race.\\n\\nJust check their credentials.\\n\\nSparked by huge come-from-behind victories at Miami and at home over San Antonio in recent days, Charlotte (41-30) enters Friday\\'s game at Detroit (38-34) as the East\\'s hottest team since Feb. 1. The Hornets have gone 18-5 over an eight-week stretch during which only the Golden State Warriors and Spurs have posted better records in the league.\\n\\n\"It feels good, man. We\\'ve worked our way all the way back to get to this point. It\\'s been a long road.\"\\n\\nCharlotte sits sixth in the East, but is among four teams separated in the standings by one game for a shot at the No. 3 seed behind Cleveland and Toronto. The top four seeds host a first-round playoff series, and if the Hornets can secure one of those spots over the final 11 games, it would be a first for them since the NBA franchise returned to Charlotte in 2004.\\n\\nThe Hornets also own another unique distinction as the only team in the league this season to post both losing and winning streaks of at least seven games. But after a turbulent stretch in January, when they returned from a West Coast trip ravaged by injuries and chemistry problems, the Hornets made a key trade to acquire veteran guard Courtney Lee. Charlotte stabilized their playing rotation and received a significant boost from center Al Jefferson\\'s return after a two-month absence to recover from a knee injury.\\n\\n\"We were just talking about it the other day -- at one point, we were like 17-20 and going through that rough stretch with two January trips out west,\" Lin said. \"But I remember us at that point, and we were kind of like, \\'Hey, it\\'s got to be now or never. We know what we\\'re capable of ... we really have to lock in now.\\' And now, we\\'re like at 40 wins.\"\\n\\nWhat transpired was a transformation in which coach Steve Clifford demanded more defensive accountability from a team he had already freed up to play more of an open, up-tempo, 3-point jacking style on the other side of the ball. Essentially, Jefferson\\'s early injury opened the door for the Hornets to chuck their plodding, post-heavy system. The offseason acquisitions of versatile swingman Nicolas Batum and Lin, the trade for Lee and the resurgence of veteran forward Marvin Williams gave Charlotte the interchangeable talent to spread the floor, run and shoot a ton of 3-pointers.\\n\\nSuddenly, at least schematically, they became a poor man\\'s Warriors.\\n\\nThe Hornets have scored at least 100 points in 10 of their past 13 games and have made 13 or more 3-pointers in 18 games this season, the most behind only the Houston Rockets and Warriors. Charlotte has already set franchise records for 3-pointers made (746) and attempted (2,081).\\n\\n\"It feels good, man,\" said guard Kemba Walker, who is averaging 22.8 points and shooting 39.1 percent from 3-point range in March. \"We\\'ve worked our way all the way back to get to this point. It\\'s been a long road. Guys were unhealthy and it was just a really bad losing streak earlier in the season. For us to be back, it\\'s pretty impressive. Bringing in Nic, Jeremy Lamb, Jeremy Lin, just guys who can make plays, it\\'s really important we have guys like that. It just takes so much pressure off myself.\"\\n\\nAnother key has been balance.\\n\\nInjuries and attrition have led to Charlotte using more than a dozen different starting lineups, but even that burden has been a bit of a blessing. It\\'s also resulted in 10 different players having led the team at least once in scoring this season, 11 leading a game in rebounding and another seven in assists.\\n\\n\"I\\'d say our ball movement has been the biggest thing,\" Clifford said of his team\\'s recent success. \"Our ball movement starts when the guys that you are playing through are unselfish. Those guys are willing to make the right play. When your best players move the ball, it becomes contagious.\"\\n\\nThat unselfish spirit was underscored by Jefferson accepting a role off the bench when he returned from the knee injury to a team that had basically undergone a midseason makeover during his absence. His most productive outing came in last week\\'s win in Miami; Jefferson started the second half because of an injury to Cody Zeller and finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes. Charlotte\\'s bench scored 38 points, including four clutch free throws from Lin, to secure the 109-106 win.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t ask for a better way than how Coach did it, with me coming off the bench trying to get myself in shape and in better rhythm,\" Jefferson said. \"Every game has just been getting better and better. And when it\\'s time for me to step up like I did and play big-time minutes, I was able to do it.\"\\n\\nThe Hornets have been fairly consistent on offense throughout the season. But tightening the reigns defensively factored into Monday\\'s historic win over the Spurs. Lin scored 15 of his game-high 29 points in the fourth quarter as Charlotte rallied from a 23-point deficit for the 91-88 victory. It was the Hornets\\' second-largest comeback in franchise history and also the largest lead squandered by the Spurs in Tim Duncan\\'s 19-year career with the team.\\n\\nWith that breakthrough win, the Hornets improved to 27-8 this season when holding opponents below 100 points. It was also the sixth time Charlotte came back to win after trailing by at least 15 points this year. For as much of a splash as the Hornets have made offensively, they still boast a defense that entered the week ranked among the NBA\\'s top 10 teams in points allowed, field goal percentage and steals.\\n\\nThe season has been filled with pivotal moments. Lin points to the overtime win in Orlando on Jan. 22, when Charlotte trailed by as many as 18 points but outscored the Magic 30-15 in the fourth quarter to force overtime. The Hornets are now 5-0 in overtime games this season.\\n\\n\"That\\'s when something, especially late defensively, just clicked,\" Lin said.\\n\\nFor Lee, the memorable moments were the first-half timeout huddles and halftime tongue-lashing Clifford delivered after they fell behind 30-7 in the second quarter against the Spurs a few days ago.\\n\\n\"As a unit and as a team, we were embarrassed by that,\" Lee said. \"This is our home court and you saw a lot of Spurs fans out there. And we came out there and laid an egg. So we can\\'t do that.\"\\n\\nLin offered the PG-rated version of Clifford\\'s message.\\n\\n\"It\\'s never fun having so many different things challenged about you in the timeout, from your readiness to how much you care to, you know, whether you\\'re afraid of other people, to your manhood,\" Lin said. \"It was all different types of things. The natural response from us was, \\'Well forget it, let\\'s go.\\'\"\\n\\nBatum believes resiliency is the team\\'s best characteristic. The roster is filled with role players who have either been labeled as underachievers, injury-prone or flat-out disappointments in previous career stops. Batum is also among a handful of players in Charlotte headed toward free agency this summer.\\n\\n\"We know we can do something special this year. We know that. So we\\'re just hungry to keep playing and keep winning games.\"\\n\\nBut there\\'s no sense in looking behind or ahead when there\\'s a chance to stun the East.\\n\\n\"These are times when you stick together, and that\\'s when you find something special in this team,\" Batum said. \"And that\\'s been huge for us. We know we can do something special this year. We know that. So we\\'re just hungry to keep playing and keep winning games.\"\\n\\nThese Hornets don\\'t have an identity problem. They know exactly who they are and what they\\'re capable of accomplishing this season.\\n\\n\"At times, it looked bleak and we were struggling,\" Lin said. \"But we always felt, on paper, if we do this right, if we buy in, if guys get healthy and stay healthy, we have a chance ... that we belong in the top tier of the East. From the outside ... no one thought we were going to be any good. Whether we\\'re changing that opinion or not, I don\\'t know. But on the inside, we always felt we could make noise.\"\\n\\nCharlotte is making itself heard loud and clear on the court.\\n\\nShame on those who still don\\'t recognize Lin just a few steps off it.\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nTom Pennington/Getty Images \\n\\n\\nThe Oregon Ducks, coming off a win over Duke, are 11-0 straight up and 7-4 against the spread over their last 11 games. The Oklahoma Sooners, coming off a convincing victory over Texas A&M, are 8-2 SU over their last 10 outings, but only 3-7 ATS. In the West Region final, top-seeded Oregon runs with second-seeded Oklahoma on Saturday evening in Anaheim, California.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPoint spread: The Sooners opened as one-point favorites; the total was 149, according to sportsbooks monitored by Odds Shark. (Line updates and matchup report)\\n\\nMarch Madness pick, via Odds Shark computer: 78.4-67.2 Ducks\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhy pick Oklahoma to cover the spread\\n\\nThe Sooners now find themselves one victory away from their first Final Four appearance since 2002 after topping Texas A&M on Thursday 77-63. OU trailed the Aggies early, then used a 39-13 run to take a 19-point halftime lead. From there, the Sooners never let A&M get any closer than 11 points, easily covering as three-point favorites.\\n\\nOn the night, Oklahoma shot 49 percent from the floor and hit 11 of 25 from three-point range while holding the Aggies to just 34 percent shooting. The great Buddy Hield tossed in 17 points, but more importantly four other Sooners hit double figures, led by Jordan Woodard's 22. If the Sooners can get a similar degree of balance Saturday, they could be Final Four bound.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhy pick Oregon to cover the spread\\n\\nComing out of a weak\\xa0Pac-12 conference, some questioned the top seed the Ducks received for this year's NCAA tournament, but here they are, playing for their first Final Four berth since 1939 after drumming Duke in a regional semifinal Thursday night 82-68. Oregon led by five at the half, then scored the first six points of the second half and never had the Blue Devils any closer than seven points after that.\\n\\nFor the game, the Ducks shot 49 percent from the field, made 10 of 23 attempts from beyond the arc, including an in-your-face bomb from emerging star Dillon Brooks in the waning seconds, and won the battle on the boards 42-32. Oregon has now won its last 11 games in a row, seven of those by double digits, going 7-4 ATS on the college basketball betting lines.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSmart betting pick\\n\\nThis should be a dandy with two of the most entertaining teams in the tournament knocking heads. They're also very evenly matched. The point spread on this game looks about right; this one's a total toss-up. Ultimately, the best betting choice might be to just pull up a barstool and enjoy the game for itself.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMarch Madness betting trends\\n\\nOregon is 4-1 ATS in its last five games.\\n\\nOregon is 12-3 ATS in its last 15 games in March.\\n\\nOklahoma is 1-7 ATS in its last eight games.\\n\\nThe total has gone under in 11 of Oklahoma's last 13 games.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAll point spread and lines data courtesy of Odds Shark, and all quotes gathered firsthand unless otherwise noted.

Watt\\'s 2015 season a quarter-and-a-half early is much more complicated.\\n\\nBy season\\'s end, Watt had five partially or fully torn muscles in his torso, groin and upper legs, necessitating surgical repair on both sides of his body.\\n\\nAccording to a source, Watt had a partially torn right adductor longus, a fully torn left adductor longus and a fully torn left adductor pectineus in his inner thighs and groin.\\n\\nBut he also had partial tears in his left and right abdominals.\\n\\nSome of those tears happened early in the season.\\n\\nWatt has never missed a game due to injuries, but 2015 was particularly taxing.\\n\\nHe broke his hand on Dec. 9 and played three games with a club cast. This week, he told Sports Radio 610 that he also had a herniated disk during the season. He appeared on the injury report with that back injury in the week leading up to the Texans\\' Nov. 1 win over the Tennessee Titans.\\n\\nDespite all that, Watt won his third defensive player of the year award -- his third in four seasons. He joined Lawrence Taylor as the only players to win the award in back-to-back seasons and also the only players to win the award three times. In all last season, Watt led the league with 17.5 sacks and also had 8 batted passes, 3 forced fumbles and 1 fumble recovery.\\n\\nHis injuries didn\\'t take him off the field until the last game the Texans played. The Texans trailed the Chiefs by two scores in their wild-card playoff game when trainers removed Watt from the game. Watt protested on the sideline, but head athletic trainer Geoff Kaplan refused to let him back on the field. The Texans lost that game 30-0.

What national championship doesn\\'t validate the winner?\\n\\nThis goes deeper than that. From two diametrically opposed directions, the Wildcats and the Tar Heels have arrived at, if not a crossroads, at least a critical juncture for their programs.\\n\\nIs Villanova a legitimate national program?\\n\\nDoes North Carolina still wield the same sort of impact it once did?\\n\\nFor one team, this game will answer that.\\n\\nOn Sunday afternoon, former Villanova assistant Patrick Chambers sent a text message to his old boss. Now the head coach at Penn State, he was on Jay Wright\\'s staff when the Wildcats made it to the 2009 Final Four, and this time he wanted to make sure Villanova didn\\'t make the same mistakes it did then.\\n\\nHe remembers the self-inflicted chaos that only added to the bedlam that already exists in the Final Four. People -- friends, boosters, whoever wanted to be, really -- were at the pregame meals and even in team meetings; Wright chatting up Vice President Joe Biden, who was calling to offer congratulations in the middle of a film study.\\n\\nUnprepared for traffic in Detroit, they\\'d spend an hour in a bus getting to a practice that lasted just 90 minutes.\\n\\n\"It was a circus,\\'\\' he said. \"But we were so happy to be there and that was the problem. It was, \\'Wow. We made the Final Four.\\' We didn\\'t realize that, yeah, we made it, but we weren\\'t done.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe Wildcats proceeded to get their doors blown off by North Carolina, losing 83-69 in the national semifinal.\\n\\nThis week, Wright repeatedly has acknowledged those mistakes, and this team is clearly not merely happy to be here. Wright was so dialed-in during the semifinal against Oklahoma he was cursing officials for missing a call -- when the Wildcats were up 37.\\n\\nThe mission is clearer this time, but the ramifications also are bigger.\\n\\nSince that last Final Four run, the Big East has folded and been reborn, retaining its basketball-centric focus but losing some of its marquee members, including Syracuse and UConn. The conference remains an outsider to the power five and football-driven SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Big 12. Whether a hoops team can compete without the endless streams of revenue that the gridiron teams supply has been a legit question.\\n\\nVillanova has answered it with a resounding \"yes\" all season. The Wildcats were ranked No. 1 for three consecutive weeks. They have won 34 games and lost just five. Ken Pomeroy has the Wildcats ranked first in his standings and, along with liking them in each of their NCAA tournament games, likes them against the Tar Heels.\\n\\nThey are about as close to the plucky 1985 team as the rumpled mess of Rollie Massimino is to the perfectly pressed Wright.\\n\\nBut the chasm between being respected as a national program and validated as one can be pretty wide. Villanova is winning in a way that no one else does -- or even tries to these days. The roster is not dotted with obvious NBA prospects, not because Wright is opposed to them but because he\\'s opted to value fit over rankings.\\n\\nWith every win in this NCAA tournament and especially the past two -- ousting top-seeded Kansas and setting records in complete humbling of Buddy Hield and Oklahoma -- fewer and fewer people are questioning Wright\\'s methods and Villanova\\'s ability.\\n\\nA win on Monday night would silence it for good.\\n\\n\"I guess the perception of us if we won it would change some,\\'\\' Wright said. \"But we don\\'t care and I know I don\\'t care about any of that. We\\'re going to be judged that way, but we\\'re not going to judge ourselves that way.\\'\\'\\n\\nAsked to explain the difference between his team and North Carolina, Villanova\\'s Daniel Ochefu made the distinction quite clear.\\n\\n\"In college basketball, people don\\'t call it baby blue,\\'\\' he said. \"They call it Tar Heel blue.\\'\\'\\n\\nNorth Carolina has its own color, its own byway (Tobacco Road), and its own way (the Carolina Way, of course), with a tradition so richly defined it practically seeps through the seams of the players\\' uniforms.\\n\\nThe program has won five national titles and is making its 19th Final Four appearance. Only UCLA and Kentucky have won more titles.\\n\\nBut when the Tar Heels cut down the nets at the ACC tournament final three weeks ago, Roy Williams actually had to give his players instructions on how to do it. They hadn\\'t won anything in so long -- no ACC regular-season title since 2012, no conference tourney crown since 2008, no regional final win since 2009.\\n\\nThat last one stung the most. Plenty of schools wouldn\\'t even call a seven-year stretch between Final Fours a drought.\\n\\nAt Carolina, it\\'s an eternity.\\n\\n\"I happened to make the Final Four in \\'91 in Kansas,\\'\\' Roy Williams said. \"There was a guy named Dean Smith at North Carolina. He said, \\'This has been a long time. It\\'s been nine years.\\' We haven\\'t quite been nine years yet.\\'\\'\\n\\nBut what\\'s happened in those seven years is really the issue. While North Carolina has been idling, Duke has won two championships and Kentucky one, the Wildcats adding two runner-up finishes and a national semifinal appearance. Kansas, too, has had its shot in the championship game.\\n\\nThose three schools have gobbled up the most highly sought-after recruits while Carolina has been mired in a lengthy investigation that goes to its schools very academic foundation.\\n\\nThen along comes this team, one built against the grain with senior stars instead of freshmen phenoms, yet always the one considered the most talented in the country. The Tar Heels were expected to be here, but realizing the expectation isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThey need to win it.\\n\\n\"Do we need to win it? To y\\'all maybe,\\'\\' Tar Heels sophomore Justin Jackson said. \"For us, we\\'ve made it here and it feels pretty good. There are so many things people say about North Carolina basketball, I can\\'t even keep up with it. First, we\\'re not tough enough. Then we\\'re not going to win games because other teams are going to come at us, but we\\'re here, in the national championship. I don\\'t think we need to win because of what people might be saying about North Carolina basketball. We need to win because we want to win.\\'\\'\\n', \"World number three Rory McIlroy has been grouped with Germany's Martin Kaymer and American Bill Haas for the first two rounds of the Masters.\\n\\nNorthern Irishman McIlroy, 26, will tee off at 19:01 BST on Thursday and 16:05 BST on Friday as he looks to complete a career Grand Slam of majors.\\n\\nWorld number one Jason Day is grouped with Matt Kuchar and Ernie Els.\\n\\nDefending champion Jordan Spieth tees off alongside England's Paul Casey and American amateur Bryson DeChambeau.\\n\\nFull tee times\\n\\nAll times are Eastern Time, which is five hours behind BST.\\n\\n(USA unless stated, (a) denotes amateur)\\n\\nRound one - Thursday, 7 April\\n\\n08:20 Jim Herman, Steven Bowditch (Aus)\\n\\n08:31 Trevor Immelman (SA), Robert Streb, Derek Beard\\n\\n08:42 Larry Mize, Victor Dubuisson (Fra), Kevin Streelman\\n\\n08:53 Sandy Lyle (Sco), Bernd Wiesberger (Aut), Vaughn Taylor\\n\\n09:04 Webb Simpson, Chris Wood (Eng), Thongchai Jaidee (Tha)\\n\\n09:15 Tom Watson, Charley Hoffman, Lee Westwood (Eng)\\n\\n09:26 Zach Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Cheng-de Jin (Chn)\\n\\n09:37 Louis Oosthuizen (SA), Jason Dufner, Patrick Reed\\n\\n09:48 Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey (Eng), Bryson De Chambeau (a)\\n\\n09:59 Justin Thomas, Emiliano Grillo (Arg), Dustin Johnson\\n\\n10:21 Vijay Singh (Fij), Hideki Matsuyama (Jpn), Chris Kirk\\n\\n10:32 Harris English, Andrew Sullivan (Eng), Kevin Na\\n\\n10:43 Phil Mickelson, Marc Leishman (Aus), Henrik Stenson (Swe)\\n\\n10:54 Justin Rose (Eng), Jamie Donaldson (Wal), Daniel Berger\\n\\n11:05 Adam Scott (Aus), Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka\\n\\n11:16 Mike Weir (Can), Sammy Schmitz, Cameron Smith (Aus)\\n\\n11:27 Troy Merritt, Ian Woosnam (Wal), Byeong-Hun An (Kor)\\n\\n11:38 Darren Clarke (NI), Billy Horschel, Matthew Fitzpatrick (Eng)\\n\\n11:49 David Lingmerth (Swe), Mark O'Meara, Paul Chaplet (Crc)\\n\\n12:00 Keegan Bradley, Brandt Snedeker, Kiradech Aphibarnrat (Tha)\\n\\n12:22 Charl Schwartzel (SA), Davis Love III, Rafael Cabrera-Bello (Spa)\\n\\n12:33 Danny Lee (NZ), Russell Knox (Sco), Smylie Kaufman\\n\\n12:44 Branden Grace (SA), Bubba Watson, Ian Poulter (Eng)\\n\\n12:55 Bernhard Langer (Ger), Hunter Mahan, Romain Langasque (a) (Fra)\\n\\n13:06 Jason Day (Aus), Matt Kuchar, Ernie Els (SA)\\n\\n13:17 Graeme McDowell (NI), Fabian Gomez (Arg), Scott Piercy\\n\\n13:28 Jimmy Walker, Soren Kjeldsen (Den), Anirban Lahiri (Ind)\\n\\n13:39 Daniel Willett (Eng), Sergio Garcia (Spa), Ryan Moore\\n\\n13:50 Angel Cabrera (Arg), Shane Lowry (Ire), JB Holmes\\n\\n14:01 Martin Kaymer (Ger), Bill Haas, Rory McIlroy (NI)\\n\\nRound two - Friday, 8 April\\n\\n08:20 Cameron Smith (Aus), Mike Weir (Can), Sammy Schmitz\\n\\n08:31 Ian Woosnam (Wal), Troy Merritt, Byeong-Hun An (Kor)\\n\\n08:42 Billy Horschel, Darren Clarke (NI), Matthew Fitzpatrick (Eng)\\n\\n08:53 Mark O'Meara, David Lingmerth (Swe), Paul Chaplet (Crc)\\n\\n09:04 Keegan Bradley, Brandt Snedeker, Kiradech Aphibarnrat (Tha)\\n\\n09:15 Charl Schwartzel (SA), Davis Love III, Rafael Cabrera-Bello (Spa)\\n\\n09:26 Russell Knox (Sco), Danny Lee (NZ), Smylie Kaufman\\n\\n09:37 Bubba Watson, Branden Grace (SA), Ian Poulter (Eng)\\n\\n09:48 Bernhard Langer (Ger), Hunter Mahan, Romain Langasque (a) (Fra)\\n\\n09:59 Jason Day (Aus), Matt Kuchar, Ernie Els (SA)\\n\\n10:21 Graeme McDowell (NI), Fabian Gomez (Arg), Scott Piercy\\n\\n10:32 Jimmy Walker, Soren Kjeldsen (Den), Anirban Lahiri (Ind)\\n\\n10:43 Daniel Willett (Eng), Sergio Garcia (Spa), Ryan Moore\\n\\n10:54 Angel Cabrera (Arg), Shane Lowry (Ire), JB Holmes\\n\\n11:05 Bill Haas, Martin Kaymer (Ger), Rory McIlroy (NI)\\n\\n11:16 Jim Herman, Steven Bowditch (Aus)\\n\\n11:27 Trevor Immelman (SA), Robert Streb, Derek Bard\\n\\n11:38 Larry Mize, Victor Dubuisson (Fra), Kevin Streelman\\n\\n11:49 Sandy Lyle (Sco), Bernd Wiesberger (Aut), Vaughn Taylor\\n\\n12:00 Webb Simpson, Chris Wood (Eng), Thongchai Jaidee (Tha)\\n\\n12:22 Tom Watson, Charley Hoffman, Lee Westwood (Eng)\\n\\n12:33 Zach Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Cheng-de Jin (Chn)\\n\\n12:44 Louis Oosthuizen (SA), Jason Dufner, Patrick Reed\\n\\n12:55 Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey (Eng), Bryson De Chambeau (a)\\n\\n13:06 Justin Thomas, Emiliano Grillo (Arg), Dustin Johnson\\n\\n13:17 Vijay Singh (Fij), Hideki Matsuyama (Jpn), Chris Kirk\\n\\n13:28 Harris English, Andrew Sullivan (Eng), Kevin Na\\n\\n13:39 Phil Mickelson, Marc Leishman (Aus), Henrik Stenson (Swe)\\n\\n13:50 Justin Rose (Eng), Jamie Donaldson (Wal), Daniel Berger\\n\\n14:01 Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Adam Scott (Aus)\\n\\nNever want to miss the latest golf news?

The blow caused Mejri to fall to the ground, and he animatedly complained to the officials about the elbow during a timeout seconds later.\\n\\nThe ensuing possession ended with double technical fouls called against Mavs guard Raymond Felton and Thunder center Steven Adams with 7:19 remaining in the third quarter.\\n\\nFelton was angered by being elbowed in the face by Adams when they were boxing out under the basket. Adams, a 7-footer, laughed when confronted by the 6-foot-1 Felton.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to let you just elbow me in my face and I let it go,\" Felton told ESPN after the game. \"Whatever. I\\'ll take a technical or whatever, fine or whatever it is. I\\'m not going to back down for nothing. I\\'m definitely not going to let anybody hit me in my face freely for no reason.

Nowitzki got up and shouted his displeasure at Roberson.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t like how he ran through the screen right there,\" said Nowitzki, who found humor in the situation because he played with Roberson\\'s father two decades ago with a German pro team. \"It\\'s the second time it happened, but that\\'s really it.\"\\n\\nCarlisle wanted to make sure the issues were raised again Friday, repeatedly referring to the Thunder as the initiators.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not looking to do it unless it\\'s within the rules,\" Carlisle said. \"But there were some things that I know are going to be looked at today, that going into Game 4, we\\'re going to be ready for.\"\\n', 'HOUSTON -- Stephen Curry says he\\'ll be very surprised if his sprained right ankle keeps him out in Game 4 of the Golden State Warriors\\' first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets on Sunday.\\n\\nEditor\\'s Picks\\n\\nEditor\\'s Picks\\n\\nCurry was injured in the series opener and missed the last two games. Golden State won the first one without him, but Houston took Game 3 on Thursday night to cut the series deficit to 2-1.\\n\\nLast year\\'s MVP was on the bench for Game 2, but watched from the locker room Thursday night because he didn\\'t bring a suit to Houston. Though he\\'s still listed as questionable for the next game, Curry sounded pretty confident that he wouldn\\'t be on the bench again.\\n\\nWhen asked if he\\'d go buy a suit in case he doesn\\'t play on Sunday, he said: \"I will not be going to any suit store.\"\\n', 'HOUSTON -- Stephen Curry wanted to play in what became a thrilling 97-96 Golden State Warriors loss to the Houston Rockets on Thursday. Coach Steve Kerr made that clear, minutes after telling reporters that his star was out.\\n\\n\"His thought was that he would be OK,\" Kerr said. \"We just felt a lot more comfortable putting him through a 3-on-3 tomorrow, probably a 5-on-5 on Saturday and really seeing if he\\'s OK or not.\"\\n\\nAnd with that, the decision was out of Curry\\'s hands, even before a pregame warm-up could test his foot. Curry might be the most powerful force in basketball, worth potentially $14 billion to his shoe brand (to say nothing of the Warriors), but he is powerless to fight the lineup sheet. He was declared inactive, and that was that.\\n\\nA related rule prevented the most powerful force in basketball from joining his teammates on Golden State’s bench. An inactive player must dress according to code. Curry, ever the optimist, assumed he wouldn’t need a suit in Houston. He was overruled.\\n\\nEven after tough losses, Curry tends to exude cheer. Not this time. After this one, Curry pulled his warm-up hoodie over his face, placed his head in his hands and froze in the pose of a man battling a headache -- or worse. He did this for minutes. Despite not seeing the court, he was one of the last players to finally change out of his gear.\\n\\nIn the haze of defeat, Golden State’s All-Stars comprised a triangle of frustration: Curry in the center of the locker room, Klay Thompson on the left and Draymond Green in the right corner. Thompson and Green had atypically bad games. Thompson missed all seven of his 3-pointers, including an ambitious go-ahead 30-footer with 26 seconds remaining. Green ceded seven turnovers and didn’t play with his usual verve.\\n\\nThe two active All-Stars dealt with defeat in their own ways. Thompson was sullen, staring straight ahead for minutes before finally sinking into his phone. Green held court in his corner, carrying on with standard volubility.\\n\\nWhen it goes wrong for Green , he’ll sometimes lean into the situation, embracing accountability. \"I cost us this game. I was horrible,\" he said, amid a few cutting self assessments. That was an exaggeration, but also refreshing. Green is confident enough to rip himself without fear of losing face. He can cop to being horrible one game because he knows the bad nights are anomalous.\\n\\nThompson was similarly tough on himself once he emerged from his depressive fugue.\\n\\n\"I’ll watch the tape on my shots and see what I can do better, especially the last two that I had,\" he said. \"The last one felt good, and the other shot was wide open; that’s basketball, and there’s no time to sulk. It obviously hurts real bad. It’s not really a quick turnaround, but I have a chance to redeem myself on Sunday.\"\\n\\nThis was a bizarre night when there were no stars, when Ian Clark played to a standard his highly lauded teammates couldn’t equal. It was a game in which Marreese Speights scored at a Curry rate, in Curry’s absence. It was an evening in which Houston’s bench looked defeated upon seeing James Harden win the game.\\n\\nFrom this strange night, we finally have a series, albeit one where Curry’s participation remains an open question. If it was up to him, he would have played by now. Although his play often decides games, he cannot, at the moment, decide to play in them. Whatever the issue with his ankle, it’s lingering. And the more it lingers, the more likely the Rockets are to linger as well.\\n\\nIt’s just one loss, but it’s a particularly frustrating one for this reason: The Warriors must now grapple with a new kind of risk. If Harden had missed his last shot, Golden State would have the series won in all but technicality. A shank would have ended this. Instead that swish converted Curry’s absence from background concern to pressing problem. The playoffs finally arrived in Golden State. When is the MVP arriving?\\n\\nWill Curry play in Game 4? Right now, even he doesn’t know, because he doesn’t choose. For one man, that might be harder to absorb than the loss itself -- though the loss surely doesn’t help. For his All-Star teammates, it’s a question they must ignore while seeking redemption for themselves.\\n', 'Two-time finalist Ali Carter suffered a surprise 13-11 defeat by Alan McManus in the second round of the World Championship.\\n\\nCarter, who knocked out champion Stuart Bingham in the first round, led 5-3 and 9-7 after the first two sessions.\\n\\nMcManus won four consecutive frames to lead 11-9 and, although Carter made a century to trail 12-11, the Scot took the one he needed.\\n\\nMark Selby leads qualifier Sam Baird 9-7.

When Aldridge ultimately departed during the first week of July, the front office immediately went to work.\\n\\nWhen the summer was over, only five players remained from the Trail Blazers\\' 2014-15 roster, with Damian Lillard the only starter among the holdovers. The Trail Blazers entered the season with just a $50 million payroll, far and away the lowest in the league. When you talk to front offices around the league, this is the detail they highlight with regard to Portland -- the 44-38 is nice, but the payroll is an achievement unto itself.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not surprised by how guys have performed on an individual basis -- I\\'m not,\" Trail Blazers president of basketball operations Neil Olshey says. \"What I\\'m surprised about is how quickly [head coach Terry Stotts] and the staff was able to make it all jell into a winning product. I didn\\'t know how quickly this group could bond, and a lot of that is a testament to Damian\\'s leadership.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s an inside look at how Olshey constructed a playoff roster with two blueprints, piece by piece.\\n\\nDamian Lillard, PG\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 4\\n\\n\"Meeting him for five minutes I knew he was the guy,\" Olshey says of Lillard. \"The composure and natural charisma he had was so emblematic of Chauncey [Billups].\"\\n\\nOlshey was less than two weeks into his tenure as Trail Blazers general manager when Lillard came to town in June 2012 for his pre-draft workout at the team\\'s training facility in Tualatin, Oregon. The team wouldn\\'t name Stotts its head coach for another couple of months, which left the front office staff to run Lillard through some drills. He shot the ball well, just as he had at Weber State of the Big Sky Conference, but the Trail Blazers were gauging something else entirely. They didn\\'t have a starting-caliber point guard headed into the fall of 2012, and their goal was to cultivate one in house, preferably via the draft at No. 6. Could Lillard be the guy?\\n\\n\"Scouting only told a part of the story when you\\'re watching from afar,\" Olshey says. \"The way he handled himself, he had this presence you can\\'t quantify until you\\'re around it.\"\\n\\nAfter the workout, Lillard returned to his hotel, where he got ready to head to dinner with Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen, Olshey and the Blazers\\' management team. Olshey likes to visit with prospects in non-structured environments to get a sense of what they\\'re like in non-basketball settings, so he swung by to pick up Lillard. Before setting foot into the entrance of Oswego Grill, Olshey whispered to Allen, \"This is the guy.\"\\n\\n\"The vibe was good,\" Lillard says of the dinner. \"I liked that they asked personal questions, that they cared about my relationship with my family.\"\\n\\nLillard had watched from his home in Oakland the Trail Blazers draw No. 6 in the lottery. \"I was like, \\'No. 6, that\\'s where I want to go.\\' I knew they didn\\'t have a point guard, but they had good players. I felt like I could come in here we could get something done,\" Lillard remembers.\\n\\nFive teams picked ahead of the Trail Blazers and a couple had need at the point guard position, but the front office was reasonably confident they could reel in Lillard, whom they wanted to start on opening night.\\n\\n\"I was like, \\'No. 6, that\\'s where I want to go.\\'\"\\n\\nDamian Lillard, on seeing Portland\\'s draft position in 2012\\n\\n\"We never hedged our bets,\" Olshey says. \"We didn\\'t bring in a veteran point guard and say, \\'This is going to be a two- or three-year process.\\' We gave him the ball from Day 1 and we were going to live and die with his performance. That\\'s an awful lot of pressure.\"\\n\\nLillard has started 340 games at point guard for the Trail Blazers over the past four seasons, including playoffs, and is under contract through the summer of 2021.\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 3\\n\\nOn a snowy evening just before New Years Day 2013, Olshey found himself sitting beside legendary sportswriter Jack McCallum inside tiny Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. McCallum, who lives nearby, was working on a story about McCollum, who had been lighting it up for Lehigh and averaging 23.9 points per game and shooting 51.6 percent from beyond the arc. Olshey told McCallum that McCollum, despite his modest Patriot League pedigree, was sure-fire lottery pick.\\n\\nLike Lillard, McCollum was a four-year player at a small mid-major, a red flag for many NBA scouts and organizations who feel that, in addition to the lesser competition they face, there\\'s less trajectory for growth for older prospects. Olshey takes a contrary view.\\n\\n\"Those are players who have to take accountability for the outcome of games from the time they step on campus,\" Olshey says. \"Wins and losses are predicated on their performance. These are players who take ownership for the outcome of 120 games in their college careers from the time they\\'re 18 until they\\'re 21. This sets them up to take that same kind of ownership and accountability from age 21 to age 35.\"\\n\\nA week after he dropped 34 on Bryant College (including 9-for-18 from deep), McCollum fractured the fifth metatarsal of his left foot. But that didn\\'t deter the Trail Blazers, who jumped on him at No. 10 in the 2013 draft, even with Lillard and Matthews locked in at the respective backcourt positions.\\n\\n\"We talked about it a lot,\" Olshey says. \"At times it takes discipline to draft for talent over need. When you\\'re five days away from free agency and you have gaping holes in your roster, sometimes it\\'s hard. We had a franchise point guard and we had a franchise 2-guard at the time. At the end of the day, we thought he was the best player on the board. We had him listed way higher. We sat in that draft room and said there is no way C.J. McCollum drops to us with the 10th pick. Whatever it was, it broke our way. We would\\'ve tried to move up to get him.\"\\n\\nAfter battling injuries and playing behind Matthews for two seasons, McCollum started 80 games for the Trail Blazers this season and took home the NBA\\'s Most Improved Player award.\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 1\\n\\nDuring his stint as the Clippers\\' general manager, Olshey drafted Aminu No. 8 overall in the 2010 draft as a 19-year-old project. A year later, he was part of the package that Los Angeles shipped to New Orleans for Chris Paul. Fast forward five years, and Aminu fit the bill when the Trail Blazers were looking for a combo forward to replace Nicolas Batum, who they traded to Charlotte on draft day last June.\\n\\n\"Non-destination\" franchises can gain a competitive advantage in the free agent market by pouncing on second-tier options while the sexier teams chase the big fish. Such was the case with Aminu and the Trail Blazers, who locked up the lanky forward almost immediately.\\n\\n\"We targeted Farouq early,\" Olshey says. \"He fit our model. We wanted to fit guys in the same career arc as Damian and C.J. We wanted players 24 to 27 years of age, willing to sign long-term deals so that the percentage of the cap relative to their salaries would decrease over time. We have two offensive-minded players in Damian and C.J., and having an elite wing defender who can also rebound his position, can play mobile-4, and would understand his role.\"\\n\\nPer Olshey, Aminu has three additional years on his deal, with a decreasing salary each season. With the cap set to balloon to more than $90 million, his yearly number ranging from $7.7 million down to $7 million will represent an enormous value, even if he doesn\\'t improve a lick.\\n\\nWith Batum\\'s departure, the Trail Blazers lost some playmaking, but McCollum fills that void. In Stotts\\' offense, Aminu is maximizing his abilities and finding good shots, and he has worked diligently to sharpen his accuracy from long range; 36.4 percent this season from beyond the arc is proficient for any player, but it\\'s especially good for a stretch-4, where Stotts is increasingly placing Aminu.\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 1\\n\\nOn draft night 2015, the Trail Blazers were still uncertain what kind of team they\\'d be come training camp, and the composition of the roster -- particularly the frontcourt -- was dependent on whether LaMarcus Aldridge would return.\\n\\n\"We were trying to run two organizations,\" Olshey says. \"\\'If LaMarcus came back\\' was one model. \\'If LaMarcus didn\\'t come back\\' was another model. Mason fit both, but in different roles.\"\\n\\nHad Aldridge re-signed in Portland, Plumlee would serve as an active backup big man who could fit seamlessly into the Trail Blazers\\' second unit. Of course, Aldridge moved on to San Antonio, and Plumlee has assumed the starting center position on a younger, bouncier Portland squad.\\n\\n\"Mason was a guy we\\'d always liked,\" Olshey says. \"We knew we were going to play differently this year. We needed more mobility. We were going to have a smaller backcourt. Without LaMarcus, a guy you could throw it to in the low post, we needed an active big, a guy who\\'d be willing to play a role -- set picks, run the floor. A guy who was more mobile defensively so we could be more aggressive.\"\\n\\nFrom Brooklyn, the Trail Blazers acquired Plumlee and the No. 41 pick, which they used to draft Pat Connaughton in exchange for the rights to Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Steve Blake. With the rebuild at full throttle, Plumlee started all 82 games for Portland at center and is on the books for $2.3 million next season. In one stroke, the Trail Blazers found a new piece for their frontcourt and offloaded another couple of million in salary.\\n\\nMo Harkless, F\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 1\\n\\n\"These are some of my favorite deals,\" Olshey says. \"It was trying to find value in a \\'second-draft\\' model.\"\\n\\nHarkless rated high on the Trail Blazers\\' draft board in 2012, when they ultimately plucked Meyers Leonard with the 11th pick. So when it was clear that the Orlando Magic were experiencing a logjam at the small forward spot, the Trail Blazers reached out.\\n\\n\"It was one of those opportunistic moves for us to be able to say, \\'Here\\'s another guy we don\\'t have to convey a true asset to acquire, a guy we really like, and we\\'re way below the minimum with plenty of cap room,\" Olshey says. \"And it worked for Orlando. They created a trade exception. They saved some salary cap, and were able to create minutes for some of their young guys at that position, and the same time, they did right by Mo.\"\\n\\n\"We wanted to fit guys in the same career arc as Damian and C.J. We wanted players 24 to 27 years of age, willing to sign long-term deals so that the percentage of the cap relative to their salaries would decrease over time.\"\\n\\nNeil Olshey, Trail Blazers GM\\n\\nIt never shows up in the transaction log, but in the NBA personal relationships are often the driving force behind a successful deal, whether it\\'s a free agent signing or a trade. In many respects the deal was constructed on the strength of a pair of relationships:\\n\\nOlshey and Orlando assistant general manager Scott Perry had been friends for years and Perry was aware that Olshey liked Harkless\\' game.\\n\\nOlshey and Orlando assistant general manager Scott Perry had been friends for years and Perry was aware that Olshey liked Harkless\\' game.\\n\\nThe Orlando front office sincerely liked and respected Harkless and their representatives and wanted to make sure Harkless landed in a good situation. These are the kinds of gestures that earn an organization goodwill around the league, and Orlando has developed a superb reputation around the league in this regard.\\n\\nThe Orlando front office sincerely liked and respected Harkless and their representatives and wanted to make sure Harkless landed in a good situation. These are the kinds of gestures that earn an organization goodwill around the league, and Orlando has developed a superb reputation around the league in this regard.\\n\\nHarkless has gone from being the odd man out in Orlando to a reserve seeing spotty minutes last winter, to a playoff starter in Portland. He\\'ll be a free agent this summer and has played himself into a quality contract. Portland owns his Bird rights, and will have to make a decision about how much they\\'re willing to vest in a player who has prospered under Stotts.\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 1\\n\\nVonleh is another acquisition in what Olshey calls the \\'second-draft\\' model, and a prospect who could have worked for Portland on both the \\'LaMarcus comes back\\' and \\'LaMarcus doesn\\'t come back\\' tracks.\\n\\n\"We had made the decision we were going to move [Batum], but we couldn\\'t lose him for nothing,\" Olshey says. \"We were trying to acquire a draft pick. Everybody falls in love with the draft. It\\'s sexy, it\\'s seductive. Nobody wants to give away a pick before the draft, because you\\'ve worked all year on it, and it\\'s all about potential. And we couldn\\'t acquire a pick in the range we targeted.\"\\n\\nIn exchange for Batum, the Trail Blazers received from Charlotte the next best thing to a first-round pick in the 2015 draft -- a red-shirted 2014 lottery pick in Vonleh, who came over with veteran wing Gerald Henderson. Think of it this way: Had Vonleh -- a 19-year-old last summer with one productive college season at Indiana University and a rookie season in which he struggled at Charlotte -- been eligible in last summer\\'s draft, where would have he gone? The answer for Portland was much higher than any pick they could receive for Batum.\\n\\n\"Noah was another guy who could join the group of Lillard, McCollum, Crabbe and Leonard, and guys who could develop if we went with our Plan B, which was the rebuild.\"\\n\\nIn 56 starts with Portland, Vonleh struggled to find his offensive game and was eventually replaced in the lineup by Harkless. The Trail Blazers control his rights through the summer of 2018, with the hopes that he\\'ll sculpt his athleticism into an ability to both drain shots facing the basket and blow by defenders from the elbow.\\n\\nGerald Henderson, SG\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 1\\n\\nAcquired along with Vonleh from Charlotte, Henderson is the veritable graybeard in the Portland rotation at age 28. The Trail Blazers pursued Henderson at the deadline last season after Matthews was lost for the season with a ruptured Achilles, but ultimately landed Arron Afflalo. Olshey had long been a fan of Henderson -- \"classy guy, consummate pro, good pedigree\" -- since they met years ago on the basketball circuit back when Olshey was working out players during the summer at Saint Monica High School in Santa Monica, California.\\n\\n\"We knew [Henderson] could step in and play on a veteran playoff team, but a guy we knew would fit in culturally here no matter which model we pursued,\" Olshey says.\\n\\n\"I was like, \\'No. 6, that\\'s where I want to go.\\'\"\\n\\nDamian Lillard, on seeing Portland\\'s draft position in 2012\\n\\nHenderson was seasoned and had a veteran disposition, but also young enough that he fit in with the Lillard-led youth squad. The Trail Blazers would hold his bird rights and, should they find themselves 15 games under .500 at the break, he\\'s precisely the kind of wing player contending teams chase for reinforcement.\\n\\nThe phones did ring in Portland at the deadline, but with the team riding a winning streak and looking like playoff material, Lillard urged the front office to keep the rotation intact for the postseason run. Henderson will enter the summer as a free agent.\\n\\nYears in Portland: 1\\n\\n\"When LaMarcus told us at 3 o\\'clock that he wasn\\'t coming back, at 4 o\\'clock we had a deal with Ed Davis,\" says Olshey.\\n\\nLike Aminu, Davis was the kind of high-character, young journeyman the Trail Blazers felt they needed to jump on before the market settled and turned its attention to the second tier of free agents. And like Aminu, Davis signed a long-term deal with descending annual salaries, his for three years and $20 million.\\n\\n\"We made a high-level financial commitment to him, and he really bought in early,\" Olshey says. \"He\\'s been great for us.\"\\n\\nA former McDonald\\'s All-American and lottery pick whose father played in the NBA, Davis never found his niche in Toronto, Memphis and with the Lakers. He isn\\'t a conventional 5, nor does he display the stretch teams look for in today\\'s power forwards. But in Portland\\'s youth movement, Davis can just be a basketball player. At 18.8, he posted the second-best Player Efficiency Rating on the team behind Lillard and a strong defensive real plus-minus of 2.89.\\n\\nYears in Portland: 3\\n\\nAs the Trail Blazers watch team after team pass on Crabbe toward the end of the first round of the 2013 draft, they started strategizing about how they might sneak their way up the board to nab a guy they had rated as a solid first-rounder.\\n\\n\"Based on our roster at the time, we weren\\'t looking to get into the second round,\" Olshey says. \"We had drafted Damian, drafted Meyers, drafted Will Barton the year before, and now we were drafting C.J. McCollum. We had a veteran-laden team and [the wing] wasn\\'t a position of need. But we had Allen rated higher on our board, and we were really high on him. We knew he would fit in culturally, and he had a skill set we valued.\"\\n\\nOlshey contacted Cleveland, who had both 31 and 33 in addition to two first-rounders, and orchestrated a swap during the break after the first round that sent a couple of future second round picks for No. 31.\\n\\nThere was initial concern about Crabbe\\'s path. The Trail Blazers were settled with Matthews and Batum on the wings, and had just spent a lottery pick on McCollum, but over the past two seasons, Crabbe has played himself into the Portland rotation. As a second-rounder, Crabbe will go into this summer as a restricted free agent after only three seasons.\\n\\nMeyers Leonard, PF/C\\n\\nYears in Portland: 4 \\n\\nAfter snatching Lillard with the No. 6 pick in the 2012 draft, the Trail Blazers went looking big and selected Leonard at No. 11 out of Illinois.\\n\\n\"From a talent standpoint, to have a guy who is 7-1 and can run the floor, jump, pass the ball, and make shots at that spot made a lot of sense for us,\" Olshey says.\\n\\nWhereas Lillard moved into the starting role immediately, Portland had more modest expectations for Leonard, who played sparingly as a freshman, and took a measurable leap as a sophomore. Olshey, who resisted calls from inside the Clippers organization to ship out DeAndre Jordan when he was slow to develop, has preached patience with Leonard. \"He\\'s still developing,\" Olshey says.\\n\\nAt the same time, Olshey rebuffed a hefty ask from Leonard\\'s representative prior to the extension deadline last October after the big man put up a 50-40-90 season. Leonard will enter the summer as a restricted free agent, and the Trail Blazers will have the right to match any offer.\\n\\nSeasons in Portland: 2\\n\\nWhen Spencer Hawes chose the Clippers in the summer of 2014, Portland extended Kaman a midlevel contract offer, the second year of which was a player option that needed to be exercised prior to Aldridge making his decision last summer. The Trail Blazers told Kaman that, were Aldridge to come back, he\\'d remain their third big man, but if the team moved into a rebuild it was unlikely he\\'d see much court time. That being the calculus, would Kaman like the team to pick up his contract?\\n\\nKaman, who has taken to Portland, decided to roll the dice and encouraged the Trail Blazers to pick up the $5 million. He played in 16 games this regular season and all three playoff games thus far. He presides benevolently over the couch in the video area adjacent to the Trail Blazers\\' locker room, where he has a good-hearted, if a little odd, relationship with the young core.\\n\\nCombined seasons in Portland: 4\\n\\nThe Trail Blazers acquired veteran point guard Roberts in a complicated deadline deal that netted them a first-round pick. Connaughton was chosen out of Notre Dame with the 41st pick in the 2015 draft. Portland took a flier on the undrafted Alexander, named Mr. Basketball USA and the Naismith Boys High School Player of the Year in 2014, with a two-year deal that\\'s non-guaranteed for 2016-17. Montero, a community college player who also went undrafted, signed a non-guaranteed three-year deal in July.\\n', 'LOS ANGELES -- Byron Scott will not return to coach the Los Angeles Lakers next season, the team announced late Sunday.\\n\\nScott coached the Lakers for the two worst seasons in the 16-time NBA champion franchise\\'s history. The Lakers are making another break from the Kobe Bryant era by firing the coach who shepherded the superstar guard\\'s farewell season but couldn\\'t coax many wins out of an otherwise dismal roster.\\n\\nLos Angeles finished with the NBA\\'s second-worst record at 17-65 this season. The team lost four more games than it did in its previous franchise-worst season in 2014-15.\\n\\nEditor\\'s Picks\\n\\nEditor\\'s Picks\\n\\nSources told ESPN\\'s Ramona Shelburne that Scott was informed by the Lakers of the decision Sunday night during their second meeting of the past week.\\n\\nSources said there was a recognition that it was \"impossible\" to evaluate Scott based on the talent level on the team the past two years, but the Lakers felt they needed a new vision that embraced the current style of wide-open play and outside shooting.\\n\\nThe team wanted to make a move quickly because of how important free agency will be this summer and because president of basketball operations Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak are working under Buss\\' self-imposed one-year deadline for turning the franchise around, sources said.\\n\\nScott\\'s contract included a team option for next season -- the third year of the deal -- that was tied to performance incentives that he did not meet, sources said. A team option was also included for the fourth year.\\n\\n\"We would like to thank Byron for his hard work, dedication and loyalty over the last two years but have decided it is in the best interest of the organization to make a change at this time,\" Kupchak said in a statement.\\n\\nScott understood that his job was in jeopardy last week. He won three NBA titles as the shooting guard for the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s, playing alongside Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy on some of the greatest teams in league history.\\n\\n\"This is my dream job, and obviously, you want the opportunity to turn it all around,\" Scott said. \"But I understand the business of basketball, and it\\'s all about wins and losses.\"\\n\\nThe Lakers are compiling a long of coaching candidates they\\'d like to consider in their search. Among the candidates the Lakers will look at are Luke Walton, Kevin Ollie, Jay Wright, Roy Williams, Tom Izzo, John Calipari, Ettore Messina, Jeff Van Gundy and David Blatt, sources told Shelburne. According to ESPN\\'s Brian Windhorst, Jeff Hornacek is also expected to be on the Lakers\\' list.\\n\\nOllie told ESPN\\'s Andy Katz on Monday that he has had no contact with the Lakers. He said he will always listen if called but it would take \"something very special\" to pull him away from UConn.\\n\\nLos Angeles was interested in new Minnesota Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau a few years ago, sources told Shelburne, but the Lakers were not willing to make him an executive with control over player personnel.\\n\\nThe Lakers are expected to begin contacting candidates in the next day or two, sources said.\\n\\nScott, at 38-126 (.232), had the worst record of the 16 Lakers coaches who spent at least two seasons at the helm of the team. Scott, whose 454-647 career record stands more games under .500 than that of any other veteran coach in NBA history, finished last in his division in each of his past five seasons as an NBA head coach. He has also coached the Nets, the New Orleans Hornets and the Cleveland Cavaliers. He led the Nets to two NBA Finals in his first head-coaching job, and he won the NBA\\'s Coach of the Year award with the Hornets in 2008.\\n\\nScott received praise from Kupchak last week for his handling of the final months of Byrant\\'s career. Scott was Bryant\\'s teammate during Byrant\\'s rookie season with the Lakers 20 years ago. Bryant scored 60 points in his final game April 13, a win over Utah.\\n\\nThe Lakers struggled to play competent defense or put together coherent game plans the past two seasons, with a roster of youngsters and unimpressive veterans. Scott also didn\\'t seem to connect with the Lakers\\' young players. His old-school mentality generated little positive effect in Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson or D\\'Angelo Russell, the second overall pick whose playing time Scott curiously limited early in the season.\\n\\nAlthough the Lakers acknowledged that Bryant\\'s season-long showcase took precedence over winning this season, Kupchak and Buss still apparently expected more than Scott provided.\\n\\n\"Guys that know me know I\\'m not happy with the way we played as a basketball team,\" Scott said last week. \"I think we could have been a lot better if we had really honed in on some of the things we needed to hone in on early. But that\\'s kind of the price you\\'ve got to pay with young guys too. It takes some young guys a bit longer to develop, but the bottom line is the record, and that\\'s what you judge guys by.\"\\n\\nScott had two seasons with team options left on his contract.\\n\\nThe Lakers are looking for their fifth head coach since Phil Jackson left in 2011. Mike Brown and Mike D\\'Antoni were fired before Scott, and interim coach Bernie Bickerstaff also had a short run. The Lakers waited to fire Scott while two top candidates for head-coaching positions took other jobs: Tom Thibodeau landed in Minnesota, and Scott Brooks was hired by Washington.\\n\\nLakers fans have been intrigued for months by the prospect of hiring Luke Walton, the championship-winning Lakers forward who is an assistant coach on Steve Kerr\\'s staff at Golden State. The 36-year-old Walton, who played nine seasons in Los Angeles, coached Golden State to a 39-4 start to the season while Kerr was sidelined by a back injury.\\n\\nThe Lakers\\' new coach will inherit a young, patchwork roster with a core of intriguing talent. Russell, Randle and Clarkson are all solid players, and the Lakers will keep their high draft pick if they finish in the top three of the NBA draft lottery next month. The Lakers also have more than $40 million in salary-cap room to offer free agents, and Scott\\'s absence could help there as well.\\n\\nThe once-glamorous franchise has been incredibly unsuccessful in attracting or keeping marquee free agents over the past four seasons. The team even lost Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol to other teams for relatively modest contracts. But the departures of Bryant and Scott combined with the installation of a credible head coach could prove more enticing to stars interested in the benefits of playing in the Hollywood spotlight.\\n\\nInformation from The Associated Press, ESPN\\'s Stephen A. Smith, Ramona Shelburne and Baxter Holmes, and ESPN Stats & Information was used in this report.\\n', 'After the Philadelphia Eagles essentially dismissed him as their long-term answer at quarterback, Sam Bradford\\xa0has reportedly requested a trade.\\n\\nESPN\\'s Adam Schefter reported the news Monday, adding Bradford won\\'t be attending any additional sessions in the team\\'s offseason program. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported Bradford will be fined if he does not show up to minicamp. If the holdout continues through training camp, he will give up 25 percent of his signing bonus, noting he will lose more if he misses regular season action.\\n\\nBradford\\'s desire to get out of Philadelphia comes as little surprise after the Eagles traded with the Cleveland Browns last week to obtain the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft.\\n\\nHowever, Eagles executive vice president of football operations\\xa0Howie Roseman spoke with CSN Philadelphia\\'s John Clark after Schefter\\'s report broke Monday, via Chris McPherson of PhiladelphiaEagles.com, expressing his support for Bradford:\\n\\n\"I want to reiterate our support for Sam Bradford\\xa0and go back to our statements last week - that Sam is our starting quarterback,\" Roseman said. \"His agent and Sam know how we feel about him. These workouts are voluntary. We look forward to seeing Sam again in the near future.\"\\n\\nAs a follow-up question, Roseman was asked if there was concern that Bradford will not show up for the mandatory portions of the offseason program.\\n\\n\"No, I think you talk about Sam and what a pro he is,\" Roseman said. \"Him and his agent, we\\'ve worked well together for a long period of time. He loves to play the game. We look forward to seeing him soon.\"\\n\\nThe deal with Cleveland suggests Philadelphia will choose one of the two top QB prospects in Jared Goff and Carson Wentz. That also seemingly creates a situation where Bradford is a lame-duck starter of sorts—a stopgap option until the Eagles signal-caller of the future is ready to step in.\\n\\nMoving up to draft a QB so high is a bit of a surprise on Philadelphia\\'s part, considering it reaffirmed its commitment to Bradford with a lucrative two-year, $35 million contract this offseason, per Spotrac.\\n\\nFurther complicating matters is how the team reportedly still would like Bradford to be its starter this coming season. According to NFL Network\\'s Ian Rapoport, Philadelphia wants Bradford as its No. 1 QB in 2016 and was \"blindsided\" by his trade request.\\n\\nAlthough he showed some rust after not playing a down in 2014, Bradford played well toward the end of last season, registering a passer rating of 91.4 or better in six of his final seven starts.\\n\\nCSNPhilly.com\\'s Reuben Frank was among those who had no sympathy for Bradford:\\n\\n\\n\\nBradford has made over $100 million. ZERO winning seasons. ZERO playoffs. And now his feelings are hurt because he\\'s being asked to compete?\\n\\nThe 28-year-old is a former No. 1 overall pick who\\'s evidently not intent to settle on the massive amounts of money he\\'s made to date, though. Bradford seemingly wants to prove he was worth that billing.\\n\\nIf he remains with the Eagles, he likely won\\'t have more than a season or two to do so unless he plays at a truly elite level.\\n\\nBradford\\'s injury history is concerning, particularly his twice-torn left ACL, but since he held up for 14 games in 2015 and showed promise toward the end of the year, there should be a decent trade market for him.\\n\\nIn addition to avoiding a potential locker room rift with its prospective new QB by dealing Bradford away, Philadelphia could regain a decent draft asset as compensation. Such a move would at least somewhat make up for the trove of picks it dealt to Cleveland, a haul that included a 2017 first-rounder and a 2018 second-round choice.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nTony Avelar/Associated Press \\n\\n\\nThe San Francisco 49ers will institute a rule ensuring at least one woman is interviewed for every opening on the business side of the operation, Jane McManus of espnW.com reported on Tuesday.\\xa0\\n\\nA league spokesperson told McManus the 49ers are the first team to \"formally announce adopting the initiative.\" \\n\\nTeam general counsel Hannah Gordon told McManus the goal of this rule is \"essentially developing, you hope...women who could be presidents of franchises.\"\\n\\nThe Rooney Rule, named after Pittsburgh Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, was originally established in 2003 to present more head coaching opportunities to minorities, as at least one minority candidate had to be interviewed for each job opening.

So let’s take a look at the stuff that astounded us most.\\n\\n CHICAGO, CHICAGO\\n\\nBulletin: Cubs and White Sox finish April in first place!\\n\\nOf all the crazy sights you can see in Chicago, it would be tough to top this one: The Cubs leading the NL Central by 3 games and the White Sox leading the AL Central by 3 as we flipped our calendars to May.\\n\\nIf you said to yourself, “Hey self, that seems really rare,” well, you’ve got that right. How many other times, since baseball went to two leagues, have both the Cubs and White Sox finished April in outright possession of first place? Exactly once!\\n\\nThat was in 2008, when both teams went on to win their divisions. But before that? I was insane enough to go through the standings for every April back through 1901. Never happened. Just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating, I asked the Elias Bureau to double-check. They verified that it’s never happened.\\n\\nThey did remind me that in 1973, the Cubs were tied with the Mets for first at the end of April and the White Sox (10-5) led the Royals (13-8) by percentage points. But that was it, even if you include ties for the top.\\n\\nAnd how many times in history have we ever finished an April in which the Cubs and White Sox had the best records in their leagues? How about zero times? Yes, zero before this.\\n\\nSo is this the Year of the Cubs or the Year of the White Sox? Doesn’t matter. It’s the Year of Chicago.\\n\\nNO LOSING STREAKS FOR THE CUBS\\n\\nBulletin: Cubs go through April without losing two in a row!\\n\\nEven if we’re not quite ready to decree this the Year of the Cubs, it was definitely the April of the Cubs. And right at the top of their list of fabulous feats last month? How about not losing two games in a row -- at any point.\\n\\nSo when was the last time the Cubs made it through April without a single two-game losing streak? How about 1952! But as Elias reports, they only played 13 games all month back then (and went 9-4).\\n\\nWhich means it’s time to delve deeper. What was the last year any Cubs team went this many games into a season without a two-game losing streak? That would be, oh, a mere 109 years ago, according to Elias. Wildfire Schulte’s 1907 Cubs went 33 games deep into that season before finally losing two in a row – on May 26 and 27!\\n\\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENTIAL?\\n\\nBulletin: Cubs have plus-79 run differential in April!\\n\\nOK, one more on the Cubs. They scored 136 runs in April. That was the most in baseball. Meanwhile, they allowed just 57 runs. That was the fewest in baseball.\\n\\nSo here’s what you need to know:\\n\\nLast time the Cubs had a plus-79 run differential in ANY calendar month? How about September of 1935 (when they went plus-90 on their way to the World Series), Elias reports.\\n\\nLast time the Cubs had a plus-79 run differential in ANY calendar month?

Those four years: 1984, 1989, 2004 and 2008.\\n\\nSo, um, viva la differential!\\n\\nNO WINNING STREAKS FOR THE ASTROS\\n\\nBulletin: Astros go through April without winning two in a row!\\n\\nWhere would you rank those Houston Astros on your Most Disappointing Teams list? We’d place them solidly at No. 1. And speaking of that number one, that was the Astros’ longest winning streak in April: One.\\n\\nSo how rare is it for a team to make the postseason one year and then go through the entire month of April the next year without winning two games in a row? Well, it may not be that rare by Cubs standards. But for anybody else? Yikes.\\n\\nThe last team to do it? Elias tells us it was Gary Mathews Sr.’s 1982 Phillies, who made it through a win-streak-free 19-game April before finally winning back-to-back on May 2 and 3 -- games No. 22 and 23.\\n\\nBut there’s an asterisk alert. That Phillies team only made the “postseason” the year before because it was a strike year and they were in first place when the strike hit in June. So baseball decided to match up the first-half and second-half leaders in each division that October. Hence, those Phillies were a “playoff team.”\\n\\nThe last team to do it without an asterisk was Amos Otis’ 1981 Royals. That team’s first two-game winning streak came on May 1 and 2. In games 14 and 15.\\n\\nBut no matter how you compute this, one thing doesn’t change: never in Carlos Correa’s lifetime has a playoff team spent this much time hunting for a two-game winning streak.\\n\\nOH, ATLANTA\\n\\nBulletin: Braves have nine-game and eight-game losing streaks in the same month!\\n\\nWell, the Braves may not have made the playoffs last year. But if the Astros are looking for a team that had a worse April than they had, Atlanta would be the place to look.\\n\\nYou might recall the Braves started out the season by going a grim 0-9. Then, after a brief intermission for a four-game winning streak, they turned around and lost eight more games in a row.\\n\\nSo how many teams in history have ever had two losing streaks that long in the same April? Well, that’s actually a trick question.\\n\\nTechnically, only Dmitri Young’s 2003 Tigers ever had two losing streaks like that. They also started the year 0-9, then won a game, then lost eight more in a row on the way to a scary 3-22 April and 119-loss season. But if we’re being technical, we also have to note that they played their opener that year on March 31. So you be the judge of whether they did it twice “in April.”\\n\\nAnd then there’s another team whose April losing binge doesn’t quite fit these exact criteria. That would be Jeff Stone’s 1988 Orioles, covered by the great Tim Kurkjian, who made history by kicking off their season with a historic 21-game losing streak. So technically, they didn’t have two separate losing streaks as long as this team in Atlanta just had. They merely squished all the losses together in one big streak.\\n\\nEither way, it’s safe to say these would be two teams the Braves would not want to go down in history with. And neither would anyone else!\\n\\nBELOW SEA LEVEL IN THE NL WEST\\n\\nBulletin: Every team in the NL West finishes April with a losing record!\\n\\nThe bad news for the Dodgers, Giants and Rockies is that they came out of April one game under .500. The good news? That was somehow all it took for them to wind up the month in a virtual tie for first place -- in a division in which everyone was submerged below sea level.\\n\\nSo how rare is that, you ask? I can help you with that, I say. Just two other times in the division-play era have we looked up on May 1 and found an entire division under .500.\\n\\nThe last time it happened? That was 1996, when the Astros and Cubs finished April at 13-14 – and tied for first place in the NL Central. FYI, the Cardinals won the division that year – with 88 wins.\\n\\nThe only other year it happened? That was 1994 in the AL West, when your first-place team, as we moved into May, was those 10-13 Seattle Mariners. And boy did that turn out to be a harbinger of things (and losses) to come. When the strike pulled the plug on the season that August, all four teams in that division were at least 10 games under .500 (with Texas “on top” at 52-62).\\n\\nSo is that where the NL West derby is headed? Hmmm. I’ll take the “over.”\\n\\nBEST STORY OF THE MONTH\\n\\nBulletin: Trevor Story makes history with 10 April homers and 17 extra-base hits!\\n\\nTen home runs. And a total of 17 extra-base hits. Did anyone in baseball have a more astounding month than the rookie shortstop for the Colorado Rockies? Let’s put that month in perspective this way:\\n\\nJust two players since 1900 got that many extra-base hits in their first calendar month in the big leagues, according to Elias. One was Joe DiMaggio (23 extra-base hits in May of 1936). The other was Albert Pujols (17, in April of 2001).\\n\\nJust two players since 1900 got that many extra-base hits in their first calendar month in the big leagues, according to Elias. One was Joe DiMaggio (23 extra-base hits in May of 1936). The other was Albert Pujols (17, in April of 2001).\\n\\nBut ... DiMaggio hit just four home runs that May. And Pujols hit only eight homers that April. So get the picture? No player in modern history piled up at least 17 extra-base hits and 10 homers in his very first month in the major leagues. Wow.\\n\\nBut ... DiMaggio hit just four home runs that May. And Pujols hit only eight homers that April. So get the picture? No player in modern history piled up at least 17 extra-base hits and 10 homers in his very first month in the major leagues. Wow.\\n\\nHere, though, is the best way to sum this up. What do all these stars have in common: Andrew McCutchen, Joey Votto, Robinson Cano, Adam Jones, David Wright, Evan Longoria, Victor Martinez? The answer: They’ve never had 10 home runs and 17 extra-base hits in ANY month they’ve spent in the big leagues. But Trevor Story just did that in his FIRST month in the big leagues. And that’s just mind-boggling.\\n\\nHere, though, is the best way to sum this up.

(AP) — Stephen Curry was expected back on the court for more light shooting Monday to test his sprained right knee, still with the hope he could be ready to return for Golden State\\'s Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals Saturday at Portland. \\n\\n Coach Steve Kerr said Monday that the reigning MVP wouldn\\'t be available for Tuesday night\\'s Game 2 with the Warriors up 1-0 in the best-of-seven series after a 118-106 win Sunday in the opener. \\n\\n \"I\\'ll just say he\\'s doubtful just so we give everybody something to chew on,\" Kerr joked. \"He\\'s not playing tomorrow, but he\\'s doubtful.\" \\n\\n Curry only briefly showed his face during the team\\'s shooting time Monday. Golden State didn\\'t hold a formal practice but instead watched film and shot around. He didn\\'t take any shots during the portion the media could watch. \\n\\n \"We have a huge break between 2 and 3. Hopefully we can get our MVP back,\" center Andrew Bogut said. \\n\\n The superstar point guard sprained the MCL in his knee during a Game 4 first-round victory at Houston on April 24 when he slipped on a wet spot just before halftime. Curry also dealt with an ankle injury during the first round and had just returned from that when he got hurt again. \\n\\n In the first seven quarters without him since the knee injury, the Warriors outscored their opponents by 80 points. \\n\\n With Golden State scheduled to take Wednesday off from practice, Curry\\'s first chance to scrimmage in a 5-on-5 scenario would likely be Thursday - and that step would be paramount to determining if he is ready to come back this weekend, Kerr said. Curry will likely have his minutes limited initially to avoid re-injury. \\n\\n \"Thursday, we will definitely get up and down and hopefully he\\'ll be able to take part, but we don\\'t know yet,\" Kerr said. \"We had the same situation in Houston. We wanted to get him back. We got two days of work in and you could see that he was rusty, but he still makes an impact just being out on the floor. I don\\'t know how it\\'ll play out here. It\\'s not like if we\\'re 2-2 or something we\\'re not going to bring him back. We can\\'t let the series score determine whether we bring him back, it\\'s really based on his health and his rhythm. So we\\'ll do our best to help him get that rhythm in practice and then try to put him in the best position once he is back to make an impact, maybe without having to be Superman.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', ' TORONTO (AP) — Miami forward Chris Bosh is in Toronto for the Heat\\'s opening game of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Raptors but remains on the inactive list. \\n\\n Bosh has expressed a desire to return to action after missing the final 29 games of the regular season and Miami\\'s first-round victory over Charlotte. The 11-time All-Star has not played since a blood clot was found in his left calf during February\\'s All-Star break in Toronto. It\\'s the second consecutive year Bosh\\'s regular season has ended because of a clot detected over All-Star weekend. \\n\\n Bosh did not travel to Canada with the rest of the team. The Heat have not offered a reason for Bosh\\'s continued absence. \\n\\n Bosh attended all three of Miami\\'s games in Charlotte during the opening round. \\n\\n Earlier Tuesday, the National Basketball Players Association issued a statement saying: \"Our top priority is Chris\\' health and well-being. We have spoken with Chris and his agent, and have reached out to the Miami Heat. We are hopeful that all parties involved can meet as soon as possible to resolve the situation.\" \\n\\n Bosh averaged 19.1 points this season. Other than issuing one statement saying the clot in his leg was gone, Bosh has not offered any updates on his health status in more than two months.

Forty-plus years later, he\\'s widely regarded as one of the game\\'s top offensive minds. Defying his age, Arians also sets the standard for working with players four decades his junior -- embracing their talents and flaws, while backing some athletes that other teams would pass on.\\n\\nOf course, Arians has said this all before. Talking with Gregg Rosenthal back in 2011, Arians -- during his five-year run as Pittsburgh\\'s play-caller -- said: \"I\\'ll end my career as a Steeler because this is going to be my last job. I don\\'t have to worry about it. I can retire.\"\\n\\nArians, though, had no idea how that job in Pittsburgh would end, with the Steelers choosing not to renew his contract in 2012 following a 12-4 season. Talking with NFL Media columnist Michael Silver in 2014, Arians explained that he announced he \"was retiring\" to make it \"easier\" on the Steelers, adding: \"Yeah, I was upset about it.\"\\n\\nHis final chapter in Pittsburgh left a sour taste, but the Cardinals hope Arians goes out on a sweet note when it\\'s all said and done in the desert.\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nJohn Raoux/Associated Press \\n\\n\\nFormer NBA Development League All-Star Eric Griffin was arrested Friday and charged with attempted murder.\\n\\nAccording to Sam Gardner of FoxSports.com, the 25-year-old Griffin and 23-year-old Daquan Lundy were taken into custody in Orlando, Florida, after allegedly firing gunshots at 24-year-old Treavor Glover in the early-morning hours of April 27.\\n\\nPer\\xa0Gardner, Glover told police he was struck with one grazing shot to the forehead, although it isn't known whether Griffin or Lundy is the person alleged to have fired that shot.\\n\\nThe brother of Glover's girlfriend, Gino Nicolas, was killed in a drive-by shooting April 16.

First the Wildcats recorded 1.56 points per trip in their 92-69 Sweet 16 win over Miami, and then coach Jay Wright\\'s team scored 1.51 points per possession in its memorable 95-51 blowout over Oklahoma at the Final Four.\\n\\nSo how unusual is this level of scoring, really? The answer? Very. The top 10 per-possession offensive performances in major-conference play over the past decade are listed below and, as you\\'ll see, the Wildcats\\' tournament run in 2016 really was extraordinary. In fact if my list included NCAA tournament performances, you\\'d find Villanova\\'s 2016 games here at Nos. 3 and 9.\\n\\nIn addition to burnishing the Nova legend, compiling these rankings has raised two questions. The first: Why do so many of these games come to us courtesy of the Big Ten? The league isn\\'t commonly regarded as an offensive juggernaut, and indeed in terms of overall efficiency, the Big Ten is most often in the middle of the Division I pack. That being said, the conference has long had a reputation for taking care of the ball, and a lack of turnovers can indeed lead to a profusion of points.\\n\\nThe second question posed by this list is even more vexing. Is it possible -- even conceivable -- that the greatest offensive performance of the past decade was recorded by ... DePaul?\\n\\n\\n\\n1. DePaul 108, Syracuse 69: March 2, 2006\\n1.64 points per possession\\n\\nJim Boeheim called this game \"the worst defensive effort in my 30 years of coaching,\" and for once a coach grousing about a loss wasn\\'t just indulging in postgame hyperbole. This really does have to be the worst the Orange defense has ever been under Boeheim. I looked at a sample size of 7,000 major-conference games (6,996, to be precise), and the Blue Demons\\' 39-point blowout ranks as the best single performance by any team on offense.\\n\\nKarron Clarke scored 27 points for DePaul, and Sammy Mejia added 21. The win pushed the Blue Demons to 12-14 on the season, and if you ask how such a nondescript team in the midst of a nondescript season recorded such an unbelievable game on offense the answer\\'s simple. Former coach Jerry Wainwright\\'s team had a perfect game. DePaul hit 16 3s, connected on 66 percent of its 2s, committed just nine turnovers in 66 possessions and rebounded half of its missed shots. Other teams have shot better from the field (see No. 2, below), and plenty of teams have committed fewer turnovers but in the last decade no major-conference offense has put together the entire package quite like the Blue Demons did one March day in 2006.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Ohio State 93, Wisconsin 65: March 6, 2011\\n1.61 PPP\\n\\nThe Buckeyes recorded an 83.0 effective field-goal percentage (including a 14-of-15 performance from beyond the arc), and scored 93 points in just 58 possessions. Jon Diebler and Jared Sullinger recorded 27 and 22 points, respectively, on a day when Bo Ryan could only shake his head: \"14 of 15? I don\\'t think people do that very often.\" OSU walked off the floor at 29-2 and earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, only to fall to No. 4 seed Kentucky 62-60 in the Sweet 16.\\n\\n3. Purdue 107, Rutgers 57: Jan. 18, 2016\\n1.57 PPP\\n\\nAt the time, this game seemed like merely a blowout suffered by an unusually helpless team on its home floor. It was that, surely, but it was also one of the most dominant offensive performances of the decade. While Purdue\\'s shooting was surprisingly normal, the Boilermakers owned the offensive glass and committed just four turnovers. Incredibly, none of Matt Painter\\'s players scored more than 12 points (though four Boilers did so: Caleb Swanigan, Vince Edwards, Dakota Mathias and Jacquil Taylor). Rutgers\\' Corey Sanders easily led all scorers with 23 points.\\n\\n4. Villanova 105, St. John\\'s 68: March 7, 2015\\n1.55 PPP\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s something about senior nights, because this is already our third one of these on this list. In this case Villanova got the job done with sheer shot volume. Jay Wright\\'s team committed just three turnovers in what was, so far, the last regular-season game coached by Steve Lavin.\\n\\n5. Wisconsin 78, Northwestern 46: Jan. 23, 2011\\n1.55 PPP\\n\\nThe Badgers were actually the road team in this game, but that didn\\'t seem to bother Jon Leuer. The senior recorded 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the field, and Keaton Nankivil chipped in with 16. Scoring 78 points may not sound momentous, but considering this game had just 50 possessions it was quite a feat.\\n\\n6. Indiana 94, Penn State 63: March 3, 2007\\n1.55 PPP\\n\\nYet another senior night. The Hoosiers were honoring Roderick Wilmont and Earl Calloway, and the seniors combined for 36 points (off the bench).\\n\\n7. Ohio State 104, Penn State 69: Jan. 5, 2006\\n1.55 PPP\\n\\nDid I mention that Penn State wasn\\'t very good at defense in the mid-aughts? Ron Lewis came off the bench for Thad Matta and scored 26 points on 10-of-11 shooting.\\n\\n8. Wisconsin 82, Iowa 50: Jan. 20, 2015\\n1.52 PPP\\n\\nWisconsin fans will still tell you that the correct number for Badger turnovers in this game is really zero, and not the one that Ryan\\'s team was charged with.\\n\\n9. Syracuse 107, DePaul 59: March 5, 2011\\n1.52 PPP\\n\\nWell, isn\\'t this ironic? It took five years, but the Orange avenged their humiliating 2006 loss to DePaul. Turnabout is fair play, and, yes, it was senior night.\\n\\n10. Texas A&M 86, Colorado 69: Jan. 12, 2008\\n1.50 PPP\\n\\nThis was the first major-conference game Mark Turgeon ever coached, and he\\'ll have a hard time ever duplicating the 1.50 points per trip his Aggies posted that day.

They host the New York Islanders in Game 5 of this second-round series on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET at Amalie Arena. Here’s what to watch for:\\n\\nHome ice: The Lightning are 4-1 at home this postseason, with the only loss coming against the Islanders in Game 1. Tampa coach Jon Cooper said it best after the team’s 2-1 overtime win in Game 4 Saturday in Brooklyn: \"We can’t take for granted that we’re going home,\" he said. \"The one thing we have learned is you get the other team’s A-game on those opportunities to close a team out. We saw it when we played Detroit [in the first round], and they were giving us everything we could possibly handle and I’m sure that’s going to happen in Game 5.\"\\n\\nLast spring, on their run to the Cup finals, the Lightning were 6-7 on home ice. The Islanders have thrown everything they had at Tampa in Games 3 and 4 but New York came away on the losing end both times. Amalie Arena is going to be loud and Lightning fans are going to be jacked up, so the Islanders need to strike early and often. If New York is able to get a lead, it needs to keep pressuring and not give up. The Lightning have struggled in first periods this postseason and they need to clean that up if they want to advance and have success if they’re able to reach the conference finals again.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a quick turnaround here on Sunday, afternoon game,\" said Islanders captain John Tavares. \"We\\'ve just got to win one, so we\\'ll start there. We believe in this team. Everyone\\'s been sticking together all year and overcame a lot. It\\'s a great opportunity for us. We\\'ll just focus on Sunday.\"\\n\\nMasked men: Because of those slow starts by the Lightning, goalie Ben Bishop has bailed out his team time and again in the playoffs. The Islanders are doing a good job of getting plenty of pucks on net, but Bishop has made many timely saves. It’s to a point where Islanders coach Jack Capuano keeps giving the opposing goalie credit after each game (or maybe it’s because they’re both products of the University of Maine). Bishop is 7-2 with a 2.12 goals-against average and a .931 save percent in nine playoff games this postseason. At the other end, the Islanders Thomas Greiss has been solid too. He’s 5-5 with a 2.32 goals-against average and a .928 save percentage.\\n\\nJohnny on the spot: In the first round, Tavares was the Islanders’ best player and he led them to victory over the Florida Panthers. In Game 1 of this series, he scored a goal and added an assist en route to victory. Since that first game, the Lightning have kept Tavares off the scoresheet. He’s also a minus-3. It would be a surprise if Capuano loads up his top line and reunites Frans Nielsen with Tavares and Kyle Okposo. \"It’s crossed my mind,\" Capuano said. \"But we’ve played so solid the last six periods ... . I don’t know if we’re going to load up one line again but it has crossed my mind, but at the same time I thought we’ve defended well.\" If the Islanders can force a Game 6 back in Brooklyn, Tavares needs to produce on Sunday.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nJoe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports \\n\\n\\nLos Angeles Angels shortstop Andrelton Simmons suffered a thumb injury Sunday during his team\\'s game against the Tampa Bay Rays.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nContinue for updates.\\n\\nSimmons Set for MRI on Monday\\n\\nSunday, May 8\\n\\nMike DiGiovanna of the\\xa0Los Angeles Times\\xa0noted Simmons left Sunday\\'s game in the third inning with a sprained left thumb and confirmed the MRI news.

But at the end of the game, in the closing minutes, everything that transpired kind of shocked us, to be honest. We were up double digits for most of the second half, and we led by 10 with about three minutes to go. So when Kobe started hitting shots and the game started to get close, a lot of us were in shock.\\n\\nIt was like being a part of a showcase, or being in a video game. There wasn’t really much normality about it. A guy scored 60 points and took 50 shots. There was something different as far as his aggressiveness. I think every time he touched it, you knew he was going to try to shoot it, or try to score, or try to get something going. He’s always an aggressive player, but that night, he was ultra-aggressive and tried to score on every single possession.\\n\\nHayward also admitted that, \"The [Houston] Rockets were already up by 30 when we were on the bus going to the game. So we knew we probably weren’t going to the playoffs, and that the game in L.A. was just going to be an experience for all of us.\"\\n\\nBut with Kobe\\'s historic night in the rearview mirror, Utah can only look back at the 2015-16 season and use it as a motivational tool in the years to come.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Jazz jockeyed with the Rockets for playoff position down the homestretch of the campaign, but their fate was ultimately in Houston\\'s hands entering the final day of the regular season.\\n\\nQuin Snyder\\'s young bunch proceeded to drop four of the season\\'s final five games with a postseason berth in sight, as slip-ups against the San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers and Dallas Mavericks put the trendy preseason pick in a hole that was too difficult to climb out of.\\xa0\\n\\n\"During the last couple games of the season, we were going up against veteran teams with years of experience on us, and it showed,\" Hayward wrote. \"However, it also showed us how we have to play and compete down the stretch, when we’re fighting for a playoff spot, and teams are amping up the intensity.\"\\n\\nWith a young core consisting of Hayward, Rudy Gobert, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, Trey Lyles and Dante Exum, Utah should continue to develop at a nice pace after reaching the 40-win plateau for the first time since the 2012-13 campaign.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd if the Jazz\\'s stock continues to trend in a positive direction, they should be in position to snap the franchise\\'s four-year postseason drought next season.\\xa0\\n', 'IRVING, Texas -- To suggest Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant was not in good shape last season is to suggest Superman isn’t strong.\\n\\nWhat executive vice president Stephen Jones meant by bringing up Bryant’s conditioning from last year on Wednesday had everything to do with football conditioning.\\n\\nBryant missed almost all of the offseason program last year once the Cowboys placed the franchise tag on him. He did not sign his five-year, $70 million deal until July 15, a few weeks before training camp began.\\n\\nAfter wanting to work him in slowly into drills, Bryant suffered a hamstring strain that kept him out of half of the camp practices in Oxnard, California, and the four preseason games. Then, in the season opener, he suffered a broken right foot that kept him out for five games.\\n\\nHe played in only nine games last season and caught just 31 passes for 401 yards and 3 touchdowns.\\n\\nBryant had a second surgery on his right foot in January, and while he isn’t fully cleared yet, Jones said the team is pleased with his progress so far. The expectation is that Bryant will be able to practice at least some during the organized team activities and June minicamp.\\n\\nBut the far bigger expectation is that he looks like the receiver that averaged 13 touchdowns from 2012 to 2014.\\n\\n“He\\'s done an outstanding job and been committed to being around, and I think that\\'s only getting better,” Jones said. “That\\'s what we need of him, is to get well and do his rehab and then get in great shape. I think one of the tough things about last year for Dez, he plays with such energy.\\n\\nHe continued: \"With the contract dispute, if you will, he wasn\\'t around, which is business, and consequently he probably wasn\\'t in his best shape going into the season. And then you start to add the injuries when players aren\\'t in shape and they continued on through training camp and then on into the season and we ended up not having him much last year, so if he can get his rehab done and get himself in top condition, then I think we\\'ll see the same Dez that we saw two years ago.”\\n', \"The Miami Dolphins are adding some more depth to their defensive line.\\n\\nNFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Friday that defensive end Jason Jones is headed to Miami to sign a deal with the Dolphins, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.\\n\\nJones gives the Dolphins another option on the edge with Cameron Wake working his way back from a torn Achilles tendon. Jones started 31 of 32 games for the Lions over the past two season, collecting 9.5 sacks in that time. He'll turn 30 later this month and is currently recovering from offseason knee surgery. Jones has already come back from a torn patellar tendon suffered early in the 2013 season.\\n\\nJones and the Dolphins had been in talks for weeks, according to reports, making Friday's news somewhat expected. Jones also met with the Cowboys during his extended period of free agency.\\n\", 'CHICAGO — Syracuse Orange guard Malachi Richardson is milking the new rule that allows prospects who don\\'t hire agents the freedom to return to school within 10 days after the NBA draft combine.\\xa0\\n\\nHe showed up to Chicago without representation but also had something to prove, considering he\\xa0hadn\\'t generated any real buzz throughout the year until the Orange\\'s Final Four run. That\\'s why\\xa0Richardson raised some eyebrows when he opted to sit out drills and five-on-five scrimmaging, a decision traditionally made by projected first-round players with more to lose than gain.\\xa0\\n\\nSurely a few big games late in the season couldn\\'t have helped Richardson, who shot 37 percent as a freshman, secure a top-30 spot in the draft—could it?\\n\\nWhen asked what it will take for him to stay in the draft, Richardson told Bleacher Report:\\xa0\"A guaranteed first-round, early first-round spot.\"\\n\\nWell, on Friday, ESPN\\'s Chad Ford reported Richardson has told teams he\\'ll keep his name in.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 20-year-old fast-riser didn\\'t say he had any promises at the moment, but a\\xa0few sources seemed fairly confident Richardson will (if he hasn\\'t already) get the promise he\\'s looking for.\\xa0\\n\\n\"His people are saying he\\'s a first-round lock,\" one scout said. \"Probably accurate.\"\\n\\n\"[Richardson] got a lot better, man,\" another scout said. \"Fundamentally sound player who can shoot it. Shooting is such a premium for a guard nowadays, so I do think he gets that first-round guarantee.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heard a few things, but you never know sometimes,\" Richardson said Thursday.\\xa0\\n\\n\"This rule has helped me out a bunch,\" he said. \"Being able to go through all these different things and just figure everything out. Actually being able to go through this process, it\\'s helping. I\\'m being able to figure out different things that I probably wouldn\\'t have figured out right after the Final Four.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Back then, I would have probably made the wrong decisions, but I think having this amount of time and going through the whole process, I think the decision I make will be a good one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Richardson does indeed get selected in the first round, he might want to write a “how to” guide on taking advantage of the draft rules and maximizing one’s stock.\\n\\nIt doesn’t hurt being a 2-guard with a jumper during a time in which so many teams need shooting and upgrades at the position.\\xa0The Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies, Charlotte Hornets, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers each pick in the teens or 20s and could use an extra shot-maker on the wing.\\n\\nOf those teams, he\\'s met with Memphis, Denver, Philadelphia, Utah and Boston, along with the\\xa0San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, New Orleans Pelicans, Minnesota Timberwolves, Portland Trailblazers and Detroit Pistons, per\\xa0Syracuse.com\\'s Mike Waters.\\n\\nWith teams seemingly valuing character and background checks more then ever, Richardson may also be using these interviews to strengthen his image without touching a ball.\\xa0\\n\\n\"I\\'m a good kid off the floor as well,\" he said. \"Never been in any trouble, never got in trouble at school, no personal issues. I\\'m just a great kid with a big heart.\"\\xa0\\n\\nOn the floor, it ultimately took Richardson around six weeks to find a rhythm at Syracuse. After January 1, however, he made 56 of 136 three-pointers (41.2 percent) and put together some stretches of high-level scoring.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe highlight of his freshman season came in Syracuse\\'s comeback win against Virginia in the Elite Eight, when he erupted for 21 points in the second half alone to help the Orange earn a Final Four berth with a 68-62 victory.\\n\\nAt 6\\'6 ¼\" with a 7\\'0\" wingspan, he has textbook size for a 2-guard and adequate athleticism. Richardson got up for a 38-inch max vertical and finished fifth at the combine in the lane agility drill.\\xa0\\n\\nHe says he studies the two-way game of Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson.\\n\\nAt Syracuse, Richardson mostly flashed perimeter scoring skills, particularly spot-ups and one- to two- dribble pull-ups.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when given space, we\\xa0have\\xa0seen him handle the ball, beat defenders off the bounce and get to the rack. Though finishing at the rim wasn\\'t a strength of his as a freshman, he\\'s shown he can bounce off contact, hang in the air and convert.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRichardson said he must become more consistent, but if we\\'re talking specifics, it\\'s his in-between game that needs the most work. He shot just 22.5 percent on two-point jumpers, per\\xa0Hoop-Math.com, which includes everything from stop-and-pops and step-backs to floaters and runners.\\xa0\\n\\nStill, in what\\'s perceived as a weaker 2016 draft field, Richardson\\'s potential appears to be a strong enough selling point, one that may entice a team to make a promise and long-term investment despite his questionable short-term outlook.\\n\\nHe could ultimately be one of the first to really capitalize on the new rules during the predraft process. With the old ones, Richardson would have had to make a draft decision a month ago. At that time, the NBA interest might not have been as high, given the fact his breakout came late and teams probably weren\\'t fully caught up on him. \\n\\nBut he\\xa0also couldn\\'t have known about the first-round interest that would eventually exist four weeks later.\\n\\nIt might have been a missed opportunity to cash in.\\xa0Instead, he was able to take the time to gather feedback and potentially rise during the combine and interviews without forfeiting his college eligibility. Giving that up in April would have sounded risky.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t anymore, based on the buzz.

It was the first time quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Carson Wentz were on the field together. Here's a look at how Bradford, Wentz and Chase Daniel did on Day 1:\\n\\nSam Bradford: UP.\\n\\nAll eyes were on the Eagles’ starting quarterback during his first practice since his two-week holdout ended. And Bradford seemed comfortable with the attention, throwing the ball well for the most part despite a light rain.\\n\\nWow moment: Late in practice, Bradford threw a perfect rainbow to wide receiver Jordan Matthews down the right sideline. The deep pass would have gone for a 40-yard touchdown.\\n\\nWhoa moment: Bradford threw a short pass to Nelson Agholor in a tight window. Safety Rodney McLeod – Bradford’s teammate back in St. Louis – jumped the route and intercepted the pass in full stride. McLeod kept running untouched through the backfield.\\n\\nChase Daniel: UP.\\n\\nIt must be said that Daniel looks really short when he’s next to Sam Bradford and Carson Wentz on the field. But he does know Doug Pederson’s offense and did a decent job of running the second-team offense.\\n\\nWow Moment: Daniel found tight end Trey Burton on consecutive plays for 20-yard gains. Both throws were spot-on and led Burton so he could continue running.\\n\\nWhoa Moment: Daniel badly overthrew a wide-open Josh Huff running down the right sideline.\\n\\nCarson Wentz: UP.\\n\\nWentz seemed very enthusiastic, rushing to take his turn behind center. He has a coltish quality about him, but he also appears to know what he’s doing. At one point he was in the shotgun and looked back at running back Wendell Smallwood. Wentz waved his arm, moving Smallwood from the left side to the right.\\n\\nWow Moment: Wentz threw a bullet to Huff. The ball was thrown so hard it knocked Huff back a couple of steps. He held on, but Wentz's arm strength was noticeable.\\n\\nWhoa Moment: Wentz threw a pass for wide receiver Jonathan Krause toward the right side of the field. Cornerback Denzel Rice was running with Krause and easily intercepted Wentz’s throw.\\n\\nWho won the day? Bradford gets the nod here. All three quarterbacks had their moments, but the pressure was on Bradford more than the others. He looked like the starting quarterback, which is all he can do at this point in the offseason.\\n\", ' He never said so publicly and mostly resisted even thinking it because staying positive was one of the mandates of a long recovery process from complications from back surgeries in July and September. But, yes, the thought was there. Some days were that bad as the defending champions played on without Kerr in the first half of 2015-16, so bad that he is four months into his return and it is impossible not to notice how he still rubs his temples or swivels his head to loosen the neck. (\"He\\'s not right yet,\" one Golden State insider observed.) \\n\\n Nor does Kerr try to portray otherwise, saying he might skip the Las Vegas summer league to invest as much of the offseason as possible into finally reclaiming his health. He has lived in physical misery since spinal fluid was released into his system during the first operation to correct a ruptured disc, sending Kerr into a downward spiral of headaches, fatigue and other ailments. He allows that much even while preferring to stay away from specifics about the recovery not yet complete. \\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t equate my health with anything that\\'s happened basketball wise,\" Kerr said. \"I\\'ll put it this way. Under normal circumstances if I hadn\\'t has this health issue this would have been one of the great years of my life. But instead it was, honestly, one of the worst. Probably the worst.\" \\n\\n But quit, now that he\\'s made it back this far? \\n\\n No. Not a chance. Not even if he could have slid into some advisory role with the team and whispered to assistant coach Luke Walton not to take the Lakers job because the big chair was opening on the Golden State bench. Not even if the Warriors follow their 73-9 finish, the best record in league history, with a second consecutive title in June and Kerr can go out on top like few others. \\n\\nUnder normal circumstances if I hadn\\'t has this health issue this would have been one of the great years of my life. But instead it was, honestly, one of the worst. Probably the worst.\\n\\n– Golden State head coach Steve Kerr\\n\\n He loves the gig too much. Returning to broadcasting isn\\'t appealing, as good as he was as an analyst, and the idea of becoming head of basketball operations somewhere again, a role he had for three years with the Suns, practically makes him cringe. GMs are separated from the team a lot, and the daily interaction is exactly what Kerr enjoys most. Nothing at age 50, far removed from a playing career of five championships with the Bulls and Spurs, compares to the competitive energy, the trash talking, the camaraderie, the adrenaline rush of being on the sideline and under pressure, especially in the playoffs. \\n\\n That is why Kerr fought his way back to the Warriors. It\\'s not that he wanted to get healthy to return to the job. He wanted to return to the job to get healthy. \\n\\n Kerr required the frenzy of the 2015-16 Warriors. \\n\\n \"I needed the job to distract me and engage me,\" he said. \\n\\n Seriously. The hot lights of going for 73 wins to knock the 1995-96 Bulls team that included a reserve guard named Steve Kerr from the record book, steering Golden State through the first two rounds while MVP Stephen Curry missed games with two injuries, a 1-1 tie in the Western Conference finals as the series shifts to Oklahoma City -- all distractions. \\n\\n \"Big time,\" Kerr said. \"It\\'s helped me get a lot better.\" \\n\\nInside The NBA: Reviewing Thunder-Warriors Game 2\\n\\nShaq, Chuck and Kenny take a look at how the Warriors decisively triumphed over the Thunder.\\n\\n \\n\\n And this has been the challenging campaign. Last season was harder in the basketball sense, a rookie coach finding his way while putting a system in place, moving Draymond Green into the starting lineup and David Lee to the bench and also putting Andre Iguodala in a reserve role. So concerned he was wasting valuable seconds during timeouts in the 2014 summer league, Kerr took a grease board to his suite at the Bellagio and practiced scribbling out plays, wanting to be faster by the start of the real games. It was all so new. \\n\\n But this season has been harder in the real sense. He started training camp, then left after a couple days. Not wanting to come back until he was sure he could stay back, Kerr kept in touch with interim coach Walton and occasionally showed up, but largely was at a distance until returning Jan. 22 against the Pacers, Golden State\\'s 44th game. And while he did accomplish the goal of avoiding another leave of absence, there were a lot of difficult moments along the way that kept him from fully enjoying 73-9 and a trip into at least the third round of the playoffs. \\n\\n \"He could have been laying on a bed in a solid-colored room sort of just staring at walls,\" said Warriors player development coach Bruce Fraser, a Kerr friend since they were teammates at the University of Arizona in the 1980s. \"I think the emotional toll it was taking on him of not being involved, not having some of the daily things that he likes about this -- the relationships, the routines, the cerebral element that makes him think. \\n\\n \"And also maybe there\\'s an element of him letting everyone down in there, that he had to get back for his own sake, to gain those things back. Even though the symptoms may stay the same, his mind was at least active and off of what the symptoms and the pains are and on to other things, which helped him through the days and actually helped us as a team to have him around.\" \\n\\nGameTime: The Return of Steve Kerr\\n\\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr speaks pregame before returning to the bench for the first time this season.\\n\\n \\n\\n This is as close to ideal as Kerr can get for now. He has a job in his home state, location being one of the reasons he turned down the chance to work for Phil Jackson and the Knicks, in a locker room with enviable chemistry while enjoying the relationship with his bosses. \\n\\n He\\'s not planning to go anywhere, besides maybe missing summer league. This job with this organization in this city is too good. He needs it to get fully healthy. \\n\\n \"I felt like I already had a pretty good perspective on life, but that has been altered dramatically on the side of well being,\" Kerr said. \"It\\'s all about well being. Yours, your family\\'s, your friends\\', your players\\'. What we do in terms of playing basketball, it\\'s only important in that we bring joy to people. We bring joy to the fans\\' lives. Even people who are suffering through illnesses themselves, we bring a joy. \\n\\n \"We bring joy to ourselves by competing together and enjoying the process. But it\\'s so inconsequential compared to just waking up every morning and being healthy. Even though I felt like I\\'d had a good perspective on life, not to this degree. Now I truly get it. I will never suffer from burnout from this job, I can tell you that. \\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I would have anyway, but there\\'s no way this job will stress me out to the point where it\\'s \\'Oh, my God, I can\\'t do this.\\' Because I know it\\'s a game and it\\'s a job. And it\\'s a really fun job and it\\'s a great job, but it\\'s not one that anybody should work themselves up over to the point where they lose perspective. Health is everything.

As we say, Stephen Curry was the best player this year but I\\'m saying all-around -- who gives you assists, who gives you rebounding, who gives you points, who does a lot of things for his team to have it? If you take LeBron off that team, I don\\'t think Cleveland is a good team like that. If you Curry off of it, uh, right now I don\\'t know. They probably would win games. They wouldn\\'t have won 73, but they would win a lot of basketball games.\"\\n\\nCurry had been an overwhelming favorite to repeat as league MVP since the Warriors\\' record-setting 24-0 start to the season, which broke the previous record for best start to a season by nine wins. He also led the Warriors to a 73-9 mark, eclipsing the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls\\' 72-10 record as the winningest regular season in NBA history.\\n\\nShaquille O\\'Neal and James fell one vote shy of unanimous selection in 2000 and 2013, respectively.\\n\\n\"We forgot Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points and 30 rebounds,\" Payton said in the SiriusXM interview, according to the Bay Area News Group. \"You didn\\'t think he was a unanimous decision? Who else ever did that and scored 100 points in one game? And he didn\\'t even win it (in 1962). That\\'s what I\\'m trying to say.\\n\\n\"You look at Michael Jordan. When they set the record at 72-10 in 1996, he didn\\'t get all the votes. So you\\'re trying to tell me these reporters or whoever\\'s voting that you and them guys back then, they didn\\'t know that he was a unanimous decision? Don\\'t blame that on Stephen Curry.

Of course, I’m not worried about it.

If I visit the capital, Suva, I\\'ll have to take a couple of hundred photos, every village knows my car now when I drive past and the people come out shouting and waving.\"\\n\\nThe reason for the Londoner\\'s popularity in Fiji is that he is the coach of the national rugby sevens team - and the most successful one the country\\'s ever had.\\n\\nIn 2015 he guided them to the Sevens World Series title and he will also lead the team at this summer\\'s Rio Olympics, where rugby sevens will make its debut.\\n\\nAnd, for a country that has won the Sevens World Cup twice and the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens a record 16 times, hopes of a first ever Olympic medal are sky high.\\n\\n\"Suddenly we have a sport in the Games where we do get a lot of global success,\" said Ryan.\\n\\n\"The entire nation has already gone crazy about the road to gold.\\n\\n\"The people are very proud of their rugby teams and the boys do come from the people: they\\'re unemployed, prison guards, army officers, hotel porters.\\n\\n\"So there\\'s a real attachment to the group and the whole country will feel a collective pride.

In that role he had coached England to its first sevens final in 20 years.\\n\\nAnd, while living and working on a tropical island may sound like an obvious welcome change, it\\'s not the only refreshing aspect of Fiji life.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had a revival in my coaching. From falling out of love with rugby when I left England I\\'m very much in love with the game now,\" he said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s polar opposites to the corridors of the Rugby Football Union where everything\\'s regulated.\\n\\n\"I would be told if the players had spent too much time on the field and what music to play in the changing room for optimal motivation levels.\\n\\n\"In Fiji we train them until they can\\'t run anymore.\\n\\n\"They eat brown coconuts before training and green ones afterwards. \\n\\n\"If I went back to a country with lots of money, I\\'d strip their programme down to the basics.\"\\n\\nBut Ryan\\'s Pacific adventure has not been all success and sun-kissed beaches.\\n\\nWhen he first arrived he worked for several months unpaid as his employers ran into financial difficulties, and then in February this year the strongest cyclone ever to hit Fiji devastated the country -  killing more than 40 people and flattening communities.\\n\\nDespite that, the sevens team have continued to shine and are on course to retain their Sevens World Series crown and also challenge for Olympic honours.\\n\\nAnd Ryan feels the spirit among his team is worth more than the resources of other countries who can augment their squads in Rio with global XV-a-side stars such as Sonny Bill Williams, Bryan Habana and Bernard Foley.\\n\\n\"We certainly can win,\" said Ryan.\\n\\n\"New Zealand, South Africa and Australia are bringing in very well paid overseas professionals but we\\'re picking the boys from the villages and we\\'re using that as a real strength.\\n\\n\"The fact that they have no money and the fact that this will turn them into household names forevermore in Fiji is driving the team.\\n\\n\"The negative of not having any money can really be flipped on its head for us into a positive.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re going to win a gold medal it\\'s not going to be because of money - but because of heart and ability and the local boys from the villages doing their thing.\"\\n\\nAfter their 2015 Sevens World Series success the nation had a week of public holiday as celebration. What, then, if his team could bring home a first Olympic gold medal for the nation?\\n\\n\"The boys will be given houses and pieces of land; ministerial positions; jobs for life.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll start a legacy.

The host was shooting two under at the time, increasing his lead on the leaderboard to three shots.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the day was a disaster for Marc Warren, who began one shot ahead of McIlroy, but tumbled down the leaderboard after hitting six bogeys.\\n\\nHere's what the leaderboard looks like, per the European Tour official Twitter:\\n\\n\\n\\nPlay suspended for the day.-9 McIlroy-6 Willett-5 Knox-5 Sterne-4 Hattonhttps://t.co/HVAzD9vgZZ pic.twitter.com/0uGQ7X6Zkm\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRecap\\n\\nThe rain was heavy but inconsistent early on in Kildare, and before play was halted, McIlroy was shooting an impressive round.

Players were asked to complete their rounds after an hour, but fading light and more rain meant the Northern Irishman got to play just one more hole.\\n\\nWhile McIlroy had a good outing, Willett's day was anything but. He shot three bogeys, at the second, sixth and seventh holes, and sat at two over par on the day before the first break. Willett was probably one of the few players who actually welcomed the rain-enforced stoppage.\\n\\nHis brother PJ Willett encouraged the 28-year-old, urging him to do better when play resumed:\\n\\n\\n\\nCome on now Danny - smash the back 9. 3 birdies minimum, 8 preferable.#DDFIrishOpen\\n\\nIt seemed to work, as Willett made par the rest of the way.\\n\\nSpain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello was one player who started brightly but limped to the finish.

They say me and (general manager) Doug Whaley share the blame. You\\'re damn right we do. We\\'ll share the blame, that\\'s fine.\"\\n\\nThe Bills\\' public handling of Lawson\\'s injury risk is a big part of the problem here. After the draft, amid reports of Lawson\\'s risky shoulder, Whaley told the press that the injury was \"nothing that we\\'re really worried about.\" Two weeks later, the team announced the pass rusher\\'s shoulder surgery. \\n\\nWatkins\\' case is one of growing concern to Bills fans. While he\\'s only missed three games as a pro, Watkins has battled through a number of nagging injuries. Ryan insists Watkins is not injury prone.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t a china doll situation. The china doll deal is for someone else. All I know is when he\\'s healthy, you can\\'t cover (Watkins), it\\'s as simple as that,\" Ryan said. \"No cornerback in the league can cover him, and you can quote me on that, and I\\'ve got video proof of it. The best of the best can\\'t cover him. Has he missed a little time? Yeah. Big deal. He and everyone else.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRyan then compared Watkins to Odell Beckham, who missed a number of practices because of his hamstring issues as a rookie before exploding on the scene in New York when Rex was finishing out his run with the Jets.\\n\\n\"The Beckham kid came out the same year, and he missed how many games with a hamstring issue? Believe me, I was trying to trade for him when he had the hamstring. I was reading the papers, and I was like, \\'Well, hell, we\\'ll take him.\\' But Sammy\\'s not even going to miss any time. He\\'s going to be ready to roll when it matters,\" Ryan said.\\n\\nDoes anyone believe that Ryan genuinely tried to trade for Beckham when he was Jets coach? Not particularly, although it makes for another fun chapter in the Ryan-John Idzik wedding album. The story is an amusing yarn to spin after the fact, a distraction from the actual question of the health of Lawson and Watkins. It\\'s what Rex does and it causes no harm.

But it came after a long stretch of some of their most puzzling play in weeks, and that cost them a valuable playoff game.\\n\\nThe Toronto Raptors evened the Eastern Conference finals at 2-2 with a 105-99 victory after holding on in the face of a vicious Cavs late rally. Yet, as well as the Raptors played -- stars Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan were just terrific with a combined 67 points, the most they've ever scored as teammates -- it really came amid some head-scratching, game-plan adjustments by coach Tyronn Lue.\\n\\nAfter spending the past few weeks finding a rhythm that has produced mostly spectacular results, Lue completely changed his rotations in the first half in what seemed like an overreaction from the Game 3 loss.\\n\\nLeBron James’ minutes soared, the offense stagnated and the second-unit lineup that had fueled the Cavs' dominance was oddly and inexplicably obliterated. It enabled the Raptors to sprint out to an 18-point lead and gain momentum in front of their crowd, which is exactly what the Cavs had to avoid.\\n\\nBut Lue and the Cavs seemingly fixed their issues in the locker room at halftime.

In all, the Cavs hit six 3-pointers in the quarter to chop down the lead to nine.\\n\\nMore on ESPN.com\\n\\n\\n\\nKyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined for 67 points, their most ever as teammates as the Toronto Raptors evened the series 2-2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a 105-99 Game 4 win.\\nBox score »\\nGame highlights »\\nFan reaction »\\nGame HQ »\\n2016 NBA Playoffs coverage »\\n\\nThen, Lue went to his standout second unit with James, Matthew Dellavedova, Iman Shumpert, Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye. The Raptors couldn’t handle it, especially with Raptors center Bismack Biyombo being forced out of the paint to guard Frye on the perimeter. The Cavs scored on 14 consecutive possessions and ran versions of the same play, a James-Dellavedova pick-and-roll 10 straight times.\\n\\nKevin Love, who is now mired in a slump after shooting 4-of-14, sat in the fourth after tweaking his left ankle.\\n\\nThe Cavs' fourth-quarter flurry was impressive, to say the least, but it occurred too late despite grabbing a two-point lead with just under five minutes left. James, who finished with 29 points and nine rebounds, clearly ran out of gas and was ineffective in the final minutes as the Cavs sputtered.\\n\\nLowry and DeRozan, with more energy, finished off the victory with several clutch plays as the Cavs' dizzying push dried up.\\n\", 'TORONTO -- Looking at the whole landscape and considering the challenges he has faced, Tyronn Lue\\'s coaching performance has been excellent both down the stretch of the regular season and in the postseason.\\n\\nIt\\'s also true that he looked like a rookie head coach for the first time as the Cleveland Cavaliers lost Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals on Monday night.\\n\\nThere were a handful of reasons the Toronto Raptors prevailed 105-99 to even the series:\\n\\nThe Raptors have dared the Cavs to shoot 3s -- the same 3s that Cleveland had been hitting at a record pace -- and that plan has worked.\\n\\nThe Raptors have dared the Cavs to shoot 3s -- the same 3s that Cleveland had been hitting at a record pace -- and that plan has worked.\\n\\nKyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan have awoken, and on Monday night produced the best game they\\'ve ever played together.\\n\\nKyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan have awoken, and on Monday night produced the best game they\\'ve ever played together.\\n\\nThe Cavs\\' defense, which had been shaky in the second half of the season, hasn\\'t gotten the job done under pressure.\\n\\nThe Cavs\\' defense, which had been shaky in the second half of the season, hasn\\'t gotten the job done under pressure.\\n\\nBut Lue made two classic coaching mistakes in responding to his first playoff loss on Saturday night. He overreacted to what happened in Game 3, and when he got nervous, he responded by playing LeBron James into the ground.\\n\\nFor the previous two months, Lue had probed, tested and crafted lineups that unlocked the Cavs\\' potential. He changed his starting lineup right at the end of the season, benching Timofey Mozgov. He made several moves during the postseason, specifically to create a dominating second unit, that have been masterstrokes. It was done with some sublime consideration, well-timed motivation and with the guidance of some analytics.\\n\\nBut all of that went to the wind in the first half of Game 4. James played the first 14 minutes, throwing off the rotation of the second unit. Channing Frye, whom Lue had used perfectly, was inserted with players he wasn\\'t used to playing with. And the whole team understandably looked like a mess, nothing like the well-oiled machine of the previous weeks.\\n\\nThe Raptors were playing great -- Lowry was hitting everything -- and soon it was an 18-point game. The Cavs never truly recovered.\\n\\n\"You can say whatever you want [about lineups], but I don\\'t think it affected us,\" Frye said, defending his coach. \"We\\'re all pros out here. It was us, it wasn\\'t the lineups. We\\'ve got some talented dudes on this team; that shouldn\\'t be a conversation.\"\\n\\nFair enough. But these are the conference finals. Teams cannot afford bad halves. Lue didn\\'t have a good one. He will learn from it.\\n\\nHe had learned from it by the second half, in fact.\\n\\nEditor\\'s PicksA road trip to Toronto has put Cleveland in a precarious spot, as the Raptors have shaved away the Cavs\\' margin for error in tying the series.Left for dead like his team, Kyle Lowry put the Raptors on his back on Monday, scoring 35 points to help them even their series with the Cavaliers.Keep track of every NBA playoff series all postseason long.2 Related\\n\\nEditor\\'s Picks\\n\\nA road trip to Toronto has put Cleveland in a precarious spot, as the Raptors have shaved away the Cavs\\' margin for error in tying the series.\\n\\nA road trip to Toronto has put Cleveland in a precarious spot, as the Raptors have shaved away the Cavs\\' margin for error in tying the series.\\n\\nLeft for dead like his team, Kyle Lowry put the Raptors on his back on Monday, scoring 35 points to help them even their series with the Cavaliers.\\n\\nLeft for dead like his team, Kyle Lowry put the Raptors on his back on Monday, scoring 35 points to help them even their series with the Cavaliers.\\n\\nKeep track of every NBA playoff series all postseason long.\\n\\nKeep track of every NBA playoff series all postseason long.\\n\\n2 Related\\n\\nHe went back to his rotations and systems he\\'d worked to put in place. It was his perfectly designed second unit that led the Cavs\\' comeback, which wasn\\'t a surprise since no team in the East as been able to put a finger on that group since Lue created it. He found a set with James and Matthew Dellavedova on the elbow that the Raptors could not stop in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nBut he\\'d forgotten to take LeBron off the floor.\\n\\nJames played the entire second half and 46 minutes overall, like it was 2007 again. James said he could do it, and after the game, it appeared he still had energy left. That, though, is not the way to play, and Lue knows better. The Cavs\\' offense wilted over the last four minutes, and James\\' fatigue no doubt played a role.\\n\\n\"I think whatever lineup Coach Lue puts on the floor can go the distance,\" James said. \"We\\'re all professionals. We have a great group of guys, so no matter who\\'s on the floor, we have to execute.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a good sign the Cavs are backing their coach; he has earned it. But Lue also set a standard for accountability within the team, and he probably will hold himself accountable for his efforts in this loss and apply this experience in the future.\\n', \"Heather Watson lost 6-1 6-3 to 13th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova as Britain's interest in the French Open women's singles ended in the second round.\\n\\nWatson's serve was broken four times as the world number 56 lost the first set in 30 minutes to the 2009 champion.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old Briton, who has never made the third round of the French Open in six attempts, tested the Russian in a much closer second set.\\n\\nBut Kuznetsova proved too strong and went on to secure victory.\\n\\nBritish number one Johanna Konta, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady all lost in the first round in Paris.\\n\\nAndy Murray, Kyle Edmund and Aljaz Bedene are all in the second round of the men's singles, with Murray and Edmund in action later and Bedene playing on Thursday.\\n\\nElsewhere in the women's singles, Russian 2014 Roland Garros finalist Simona Halep beat Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan 7-6 6-2 to reach the third round.\\n\\nCzech Petra Kvitova, the two-time Wimbledon champion, also progressed with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Hsieh Su-Wei of Chinese Taipei.\\n\\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.\\n\"]\n",

minute adjustments according current situation. far important build one solid team five members anything else, however. general tips making happen. choose tank. won't get far avengers alliance 2 without tank sort active party. people like keep spare tank bench, set things right, shouldn't necessary. best tanks heroes bruiser blue tactician green type, certain characters groups fare better others. make sure prospective tank move can generate protect status, load iso 8 either buff defense bruiser type evasion tactician type . don't suitable character, depend kindness strangers provide.

debuffs among moves. ideally, great tank moves, certainly shouldn't shy equipping characters, too. powerful people seem realize. think carefully team going work together. example, generally don't need

enjoy. like much snyder's previous work, batman v superman overindulges attempts gritty morose. dialogue comes off clichéd awkward it, characters suffer, appearing entirely two dimensional. fight choreography, divisive aspect snyder's films, robotic monotonous, leading uncontrollable yawns eye rolling, even biggest scenes. much wrong movie difficult find moments snyder gets things right, tend revolve around jesse eisenberg's lex luthor gal gadot's wonder woman. ultimately, however, batman v superman fails entertain and, perhaps worse, generates sour aftertaste even credits begin roll. premise batman v superman simple bruce wayne, perpetual state testosterone fueled anger fear, mission destroy superman seeing wreak havoc metropolis two years prior. superman qualms gotham's dark knight decides duty take caped crusader, including using position daily planet pen scathing editorials. accidental meeting party hosted lex luthor, ceo lexcorp, two meet throw polite quips one another, defending secret identities. one major issues movie ben affleck, plays batman, henry cavill, plays superman, atrocious. cavill can physically pull off superman clark kent, moving back forth role superhero shy, young journalist decently enough, isn't one charismatic quality him. watching cavill try outsmart batman flirt lois lane, played amy adams, torturous. almost comparable watching paint dry, except feels insulting paint. affleck, hand, far worst part movie. stiff lifeless, appearing almost overburdened existence. bruce wayne supposed charming, mysterious wicked, affleck doesn't capture that. angst ridden teenage 30 year old man's body, conflicting portrayal kills momentum character may movie. ben affleck, plays batman, henry cavill, plays superman, atrocious. quickly compare, christian bale's bruce wayne christopher nolan's dark knight trilogy also portrayed extremely serious character, bale managed bring sense lighthearted humor role needed. witty banter and, else, sense humanity within batman. doesn't exist affleck. instead, latter goes angry sullen hopeless back angry span two half hours. hour watching affleck cycle three four emotions, boredom kicks sympathy may existed character gone, replaced instead strong sense disdain poor bats. two incredibly weak performances, however, two actors can shine. jesse eisenberg, times obnoxious, delivers powerful performance main baddie lex luthor. like eisenberg roles, actor delivers rapid fire dialogue uses fantastic facial expressions accentuate lines reciting. film like batman v superman, batman superman sluggish mechanical, eisenberg's hopped up, young villain welcome breath fresh air manages feel maniacal comedic once. eisenberg also brings much needed sense youth film. batman v superman feels older should. entire movie plays like attempt brand opposite marvel movie, away playful banter replacing continuous stream war like images themes. eisenberg screen, however, movie gains back lost, feels less dire couple minutes. sense life eisenberg one actor delivers, gal gadot wonder woman. not understatement gadot's wonder woman exciting aspect film. actress plays superheroine fantastically, using every aspect comic book warrior advantage. unbelievably strong, fiercely independent utter joy watch whenever screen. unfortunately, not screen long, lack presence film affects entire feature. instead, audiences left watching batman superman stare one another deliver worst dialogue ever written. wonder woman exciting aspect film aside cavill affleck's performances, one biggest problems film encounters lack cohesiveness. without getting much detail, batman v superman springboard warner bros.' justice league films movie doesn't let forget second. unlike marvel, used numerous movies post credit sequences introduce universe characters, snyder uses one film try catch up. process, batman v superman loses momentum, dragging attention one story next without much warning explanation. disorienting unmemorable, leaving one question certain arcs included first place. snyder uses storytelling techniques, like flashbacks dream sequences, not manage fall flat film, also pretty confusing times. feels like director focused nailing visual effects film fight choreography narrative aspect completely ignored, used way allow explosions destruction screen. difficult understand batman v superman trying be, snyder seems doesn't know movie be, go creating film envisioned head. majority time spent watching movie trying figure snyder wants go next wobbling alongside characters screen move scene scene. visually stunning, disappointing disaster bursting seams promise never fully realized. barely scratches surface mediocre. batman v superman dawn justice proof, yet again, snyder visionary craftsman can't helm story. much wrong movie saved, even strong performances gadot eisenberg. even worse, movie two half hours long enough excitement interjected throughout carry audience's attention, doesn't happen. instead, found restless checking time every five minutes hoping movie just end. watching batman v superman isn't painful experience, not pleasant one. just one disappointment next, sour aftertaste mentioned before? still there.\", 'face large, like moon, looming. eyes blaze whole body crashes like continent. forests hair none, man. girl. opposites

dinner, mass murderers,' daviau says. moment went 'oh yeah!' game kind starts like movie groundhog day. players don't start over. idea resulted undoubtedly radical board gaming innovation recent years, legacy gaming. thus far daviau explored idea two stellar games, risk legacy pandemic legacy, currently working third, seafall. rob daviau although daviau's work come prominence fairly recently, designing boardgames almost 20 years. initially worked advertising copywriter, 1998 daviau joined hasbro writer text heavy games like trivial pursuit taboo, unique role company hasn't hired since. happened fit bill quickly realised loved design part writing part, says. moved job fast pure designer learned went. time hasbro, daviau worked dozens titles, including versions well known games like cluedo, risk versions anyone else. yet daviau's design experience resides family friendly games fairly simple rulesets, heart always belonged roleplaying games like dungeons dragons. roleplaying games persistent worlds, daviau explains. write character's sheet. remember kid character die, someone ripped half dramatic. dual strands daviau's boardgaming background, love deep, persistent rpg worlds experiences designing simpler, general audience games, prove crucial seeing legacy concept realised. daviau's cluedo based realisation happened around 2008, pitched idea cluedo legacy hasbro's management, rejected outright. looked like crazy, daviau says. thought 'well, maybe crazy idea.' put away. initially sceptical, idea stuck minds daviau's superiors. couple years later, rose surface discussing potential new versions risk. boss asked come ideas. think remembered said 'well perpetual game idea?' daviau thought this, realised risk make ideal template legacy game, strategic elements emotional makes people play it. just makes people mad, daviau says. makes mad dice don't go way. makes mad someone breaks word. just carry memories scars around. risk legacy play idea, enabling players physically scar board, affecting rules future games. games played, dramatic effects become. players found cities board, tear cards confetti, unlock new factions play as, even detonate nuclear device particular country, making almost impossible hold future games. big toolbox ideas draw done six seven eight earlier risk games, daviau says. risk legacy took around 18 months develop, daviau working almost every aspect it, writing cards directing art even making sales videos. quite excited new possibility, always spectre looming 'this dumbest thing ever thought of, everyone plays going laugh industry.' quite contrary, risk legacy released 2011 rave reviews, end 2012 one talked games around. commercially success drop ocean hasbro, daviau sees good thing. got go beneath radar, good, wouldn't gotten lot attention it. launch risk legacy, daviau departed hasbro, striking independent boardgame designer. began working new legacy game, interrupted gencon 2013, daviau contacted matt leacock, creator massively successful pandemic, possibility co designing legacy version cooperative boardgame saving world global disease outbreak. wrote back email, forgotten always talks about, 150 point type. said 'yes', entire email, daviau recalls. idea merging pandemic's simple yet engrossing rules daviau's legacy concept may sound like recipe instant success. pandemic legacy proved far tricky design problem cooperative emphasis. much outside designers control legacy game, need players balancing agent. risk legacy someone starts winning lot players will gang them, daviau explains. pandemic, however, players working together outsmart game's systems, legacy game's gradual upping ante, easy end one side simply overwhelming other. leacock daviau tackled problem introducing two new game mechanics. firstly, funding players changes game. players win game pandemic legacy, given fewer 'event' cards next game. lose, receive more. helps nullify common game design problem snowballing, winning leads winning losing leads losing. solution provide players broad range tools choose approach problems specific game. playing game not trouble curing diseases, really trouble moving around board. can make research stations permanent, start next game ability move. another group might no problem moving trouble diseases. will make diseases easier treat next game, daviau points out. pandemic legacy launched october 2015, releasing simultaneously around 13 different languages across globe. unlike risk legacy, gained reputation couple years, pandemic legacy instant hit. despite less six months, currently rated boardgamegeek best game existence. shutupandsitdown also voted favourite game 2015, toppling longtime favourite cosmic encounter. particularly fascinating success daviau's legacy concept two current incarnations reinterpretations already existing games. yet see legacy game built entirely scratch, persistent rules baked base version. however, will change later
